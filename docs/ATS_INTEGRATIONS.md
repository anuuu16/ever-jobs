# ATS Integrations

Ever Jobs integrates directly with **41 applicant tracking systems** that power career pages at thousands of companies worldwide. When a recruiter publishes a new role through any supported ATS, Ever Jobs detects the posting at the source — often hours before it appears on aggregated job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed.

## How ATS Integration Works

1. **Purpose-Built Adapters** — Each ATS has a dedicated scraper module that understands the platform's data format, API structure, and publishing workflow.
2. **Direct Source Detection** — Ever Jobs reads from the ATS's structured JSON/XML feed or API endpoint, seeing jobs the moment they go live on the company's career page.
3. **Normalized Output** — Despite each ATS having a different response schema, all results are normalized into the standard `JobPostDto` format with consistent fields across platforms.

### Usage

ATS scrapers require a `companySlug` parameter to identify which company's career page to query:

```bash
# Search Greenhouse jobs for Stripe
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jobs/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"companySlug": "stripe", "siteType": ["greenhouse"]}'

# Search all ATS platforms for a given company
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jobs/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"companySlug": "notion"}'
```

When `companySlug` is provided without an explicit `siteType`, all 41 ATS scrapers run concurrently. Each one independently checks whether the company exists on its platform and returns results accordingly.

Talent-intelligence platform ("PCSX" / SmartApply) powering the public careers sites of many large enterprises. Every tenant exposes the same public positions API; tenants are reachable at an Eightfold subdomain or a custom apply domain.

- **Method**: Public positions REST API (`https://{slug}.eightfold.ai/api/apply/v2/jobs?domain={domain}&start=N&num=10&sort_by=timestamp`)
- **Auth**: None (public SmartApply endpoint)
- **Data Format**: JSON — `{ positions: [...], count: <total> }`; server-fixed page size 10, paginated by `start`; remaining pages fanned out concurrently (≤ 8) with `Promise.allSettled`
- **Custom Domains**: Supported via the `companyUrl` input override
- **Notable Users**: Nvidia, Cisco, AT&T, Bayer, Booking, Dolby, Activision
- **Known Limitation**: tenants behind an aggressive WAF (Cloudflare) may 403 plain HTTPS; a browser-fingerprint fallback is a tracked follow-up (Q-043)

### Avature

Enterprise-grade talent acquisition and CRM platform for global enterprises. Avature emphasizes flexible workflow configuration and is widely used in financial services, energy, and global staffing. Career portals are reachable both at standard subdomains and at custom-domain tenants (e.g. Bloomberg, IBM).

- **Method**: HTML scrape with cheerio (`*.avature.net/careers/SearchJobs/?jobOffset=N&jobRecordsPerPage=12`)
- **Auth**: None (public career portal)
- **Data Format**: HTML — five-cascade selector chain (`article.job` / `div.job-item` / `li.job-listing` / `tr.job` / `div[data-job-id]`) plus an `/JobDetail/`-link fallback
- **Custom Domains**: Supported via the `companyUrl` input override (e.g. `https://careers.ibm.com`)

- **Method**: Single batched GraphQL POST (`https://jobs.gem.com/api/public/graphql/batch`) carrying both `JobBoardTheme` + `JobBoardList` operations
- **Auth**: None (public board)
- **Data Format**: JSON — `data.oatsExternalJobPostings.jobPostings[]` per envelope; response-order tolerant (Theme first or List first)
- **Notable Users**: Accel, Alex and Ani, A16Z Speedrun, 43North, Acre, Agora, Airframe

### Join.com

European-focused recruiting platform with strong adoption in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Join.com career pages live at `join.com/companies/<slug>`; the public REST API exposes paginated jobs at 50 per page with optional aggregations.

- **Method**: Two-step REST flow — Step 1: HTML scrape `join.com/companies/<slug>` to regex-extract numeric `companyId` (primary `"company":{"id":N` shape, fallback `"companyId":N` for skinned tenants); Step 2: paginated `GET /api/public/companies/<id>/jobs?locale=en-us&page=N&pageSize=50&withAggregations=true&sort=+title` until `pagination.totalPages` is reached or `items[]` is empty
- **Auth**: None (public `/api/public` namespace)
- **Data Format**: JSON with `items[]`, `pagination`, optional aggregations
- **Polite Pacing**: 0.5 s between paginated calls (matches upstream Python's `time.sleep(0.5)`)
- **Notable Users**: Awork, Alteos, Aitad, Capitalmind, Brandcircle, Cinnamood, Brandneo, Brunathelabel, Allunity, Citychickennhas490

### Oracle HCM Cloud (Oracle Recruiting Cloud)

Enterprise-grade multi-tenant ATS within Oracle's HCM Cloud suite. Tenants typically host at `https://<subdomain>.fa.<region>.oraclecloud.com` (e.g. `eeho.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com` for Oracle's own careers site). The CandidateExperience REST API exposes a finder-string-driven `recruitingCEJobRequisitions` endpoint that paginates at 100 per page.

- **Method**: REST GET against `/hcmRestApi/resources/latest/recruitingCEJobRequisitions` with a `findReqs;<finder-string>` finder (commas between params, semicolons between facets — matches upstream Python's wire format; the all-semicolon variant suggested in spec drafts was rejected by the live API)
- **Auth**: None (public CandidateExperience namespace)
- **Data Format**: JSON — `response.items[0].requisitionList[]`; each row carries `Id` / `Title` / `PrimaryLocation` / `PostedDate` / `EmployerName` plus optional `ExternalUrl` / `ExternalUrlSeo` for canonical apply links
- **Tenant Resolution**: `companyUrl` (full URL override, canonical) ⇒ used verbatim; `companySlug` (`<subdomain>-<region>` form, e.g. `eeho-us2`) ⇒ composed to `https://<subdomain>.fa.<region>.oraclecloud.com`
- **`siteNumber` Override**: Optional `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` field defaulting to `'CX_45001'` (Q-030 — upstream Python's documented default; ≥ 95 % of tenants honour it)
- **Pagination**: `offset=N` increments by 100 until `requisitionList[]` is empty OR `resultsWanted` cap; first page omits `offset=` for canonical request shape
- **Notable Users**: Oracle, City of Atlanta, TTX, CooperCompanies, EXP, Kroll, Macy's, Westpac Group, DTCC, Hologic, Mountaire, Mouser, Ricoh, Galliford Try, Apollo Hospitals, Standard Aero, Proskauer, Euroclear, Arcadis, BDO USA, Onity, Hillside, Dubai World Trade Centre, Zeus

### Mercor

Talent marketplace (NOT a per-company ATS) where companies post contract / full-time opportunities. The explore page returns the **entire public catalogue** in one GET — no per-company URL segmentation, no pagination — so per-company filtering is a client-side substring match on `companyName` rather than a slug-keyed dispatch.

- **Method**: Single REST GET to `https://aws.api.mercor.com/work/listings-explore-page`
- **Auth**: Literal `Authorization: Bearer` header (empty token — mirrors upstream Python's `MercorClient.session.headers`); `Origin` + `Referer` (`https://work.mercor.com`) required by the API gateway
- **Data Format**: JSON — `response.listings[]`; each row carries `listingId` / `title` / `companyName` / `location` / `postedAt` plus a `rateMin / rateMax / payRateFrequency` triple (mapped into `JobPostDto.compensation` directly — no detail fetch required)
- **Filtering Semantics**: `companySlug` is a **case-insensitive substring filter** on `companyName` (e.g. `companySlug='stripe'` retains rows whose `companyName.toLowerCase()` contains `'stripe'`). Empty slug ⇒ full catalogue, capped by `resultsWanted` (cap applies AFTER the filter so a 5-row Stripe slice is genuinely 5 Stripe rows)
- **Detail Fetch**: Not exercised — explore-page envelope already carries enough fields for `JobPostDto` mapping. Detail-page enrichment deferred to candidate Spec 016
- **Notable Users**: Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, Notion, Airbnb, Figma, Vercel, Linear, Discord, Coinbase, Plaid, Ramp (sample of the catalogue at time of writing — the explore page surfaces ≥ 200 distinct employers across software, finance, design, and operations)

### Tesla

Single-company custom careers portal at `https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/`. Tesla operates its own internal `/cua-api/` endpoint pair (board + per-job detail) protected by Akamai Bot Manager. Ever Jobs ships **two** Tesla plugins:

- **Default `source-tesla` (pure-HTTP):** Calls the board endpoint directly with rotated UA + `Accept: application/json`. Akamai-challenge surfaces (HTTP 403 / 503 OR a `text/html` body when JSON was requested) return an empty `JobResponseDto` with the `ERR_TESLA_AKAMAI_CHALLENGE` sentinel logged.
- **Optional `source-tesla-playwright` (browser-automation companion):** Lazy-loads `playwright` via `Function('s', 'return import(s)')(specifier)` indirection (defeats ts-jest's static module resolution). Launches headless Chromium with `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, navigates to the careers-search landing page, settles 5 s for Akamai's challenge JS to resolve, then issues in-page `fetch()` calls through the established session. Per Q-028, this companion is **NOT** auto-registered via `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES` — operators opt in by importing `TeslaPlaywrightModule` directly.

- **Method (default)**: REST GET to `https://www.tesla.com/cua-api/apps/careers/state` (board) followed by per-job GETs to `/cua-api/careers/job/{id}` (detail)
- **Method (companion)**: Headless Chromium navigation to `/careers/search/` → in-page `fetch()` for board + detail (lazy `import('playwright')`)
- **Auth**: None for either path (public careers API; companion adds a real browser session for Akamai bypass)
- **Data Format**: JSON — `response.listings[]` at top level + `response.lookup` as a sibling map (location-id / department-id dictionaries; the spec draft's `data.lookup.listings[]` path was incorrect and is corrected in the implementation)
- **Description Budget**: `ScraperInputDto.descriptionDepth` controls per-job detail-fetch fan-out: `'board'` → 0 follow-ups (descriptions stay null), `'detail-25'` (default per Q-031) → 25 follow-ups, `'detail-all'` → ∞. Detail-fetch failures are silently swallowed; the affected listing keeps `description: null` but still emits as a `JobPostDto`
- **Cross-Plugin Dedup**: When both Tesla plugins are enabled, rows emit under different `Site` keys (`Site.TESLA` vs `Site.TESLA_PLAYWRIGHT`) so per-source breaker policies (Spec 005 / FR-1) track them independently. `dedup-hybrid`'s hash strategy (Spec 003 / FR-3) collapses cross-site duplicates by `externalId` (per Q-032 default)
- **Notable Users**: Tesla (single-tenant; no per-company variation)

### Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD)

Enterprise talent-management suite whose Cornerstone Recruiting product powers the public career sites of many large enterprises and public-sector organizations at `https://{slug}.csod.com`. The public listing flow is an **anonymous two-step bootstrap** — no OAuth/operator credentials required.

- **Method**: (1) GET the public career-site page `https://{slug}.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/{siteId}/home?c={slug}` — embeds an anonymous JWT token and the regional "cloud" API host (e.g. `https://us.api.csod.com`), with the JWT `rurls` claim whitelisting `rec-job-search/external`; (2) `POST {cloud}/rec-job-search/external/jobs` paginated by `pageNumber` / `pageSize=25`, bounded concurrent fan-out with `Promise.allSettled`
- **Auth**: None (anonymous JWT minted by the public career-site page)
- **Data Format**: JSON — requisitions array; `externalDescription` already present in the listing (no per-requisition enrichment needed)
- **Tenant Resolution**: `companySlug` → `https://{slug}.csod.com`, or explicit `companyUrl`; `siteNumber` overrides the default careerSiteId (`1`)
- **Known Limitation**: WAF-gated tenants, the credentialed OAuth Recruiting REST API, and multi-portal careerSiteId auto-discovery are explicit non-goals (Spec 297)

### Dayforce (Ceridian Dayforce HCM)

Cloud HCM platform whose candidate career portals are hosted at `https://{client}.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/`. Ever Jobs reads the consolidated **no-auth geo job-posting search feed**.

- **Method**: `POST https://jobs.dayforcehcm.com/api/geo/{client}/jobposting/search` with body `{ clientNamespace, jobBoardCode: 'CANDIDATEPORTAL', cultureCode: 'en-US', distanceUnit, paginationStart }`; server-fixed page size 25 paginated via `paginationStart`, bounded `Promise.allSettled` fan-out
- **Auth**: None (public candidate-portal feed)
- **Data Format**: JSON — `{ jobPostings[], maxCount, count }`. Parser reads both modern camelCase geo fields (`jobPostingId`, `jobTitle`, `jobDescription`, `postingLocations`, `postingStartTimestampUTC`) and the documented PascalCase RESTful fields (`Title`, `JobDetailsUrl`, `ApplyUrl`, `City`/`State`/`Country`, `DatePosted`, `ParentRequisitionCode`) defensively
- **Tenant Resolution**: client namespace from `companySlug`, then `siteNumber`, then parsed from `companyUrl` (legacy `{client}.dayforcehcm.com` subdomain or the path segment after the locale / `CandidatePortal`)
- **Known Limitation**: WAF/Cloudflare TLS-fingerprint-gated tenants (HTTP 403 on plain HTTPS) deferred to a browser-fingerprint follow-up (Q-044); per-posting detail enrichment and the legacy XML feed are non-goals (Spec 298)

### Zoho Recruit

Recruitment ATS in the Zoho suite; career sites are hosted per-tenant at `https://{slug}.zohorecruit.com` (with `.eu` / `.in` datacenter variants). Zoho **server-renders the full open-roles list into the careers page** rather than exposing a separate paginated JSON API.

- **Method**: GET `https://{slug}.zohorecruit.com/jobs/Careers`; the open-roles list is an HTML-entity-encoded JSON array embedded in a hidden `<input id="jobs">`. The service fetches once, decodes entities, and `JSON.parse`s defensively (the single fetch is still wrapped in `Promise.allSettled` per the batch-safety rule)
- **Auth**: None (public career site)
- **Data Format**: Embedded JSON — `Job_Openings` fields (`id`, `Posting_Title` / `Job_Opening_Name`, `Job_Description`, `City` / `State` / `Country`, `Date_Opened`, `Remote_Job`, `Job_Type`, `Industry`, `Is_Locked` / `Publish`); job URLs built as `{host}/jobs/Careers/{id}/{title-slug}`
- **Tenant Resolution**: `companySlug` (US `.com` default) or explicit `companyUrl` for EU/IN datacenters
- **Known Limitation**: the OAuth REST API, WAF-gated tenants, lazy-load/digest-gated pagination beyond the embedded slice, and non-US datacenter auto-discovery are non-goals (Spec 299). Wires the previously-orphaned `Site.ZOHORECRUIT` enum member to a real plugin.

### ClearCompany

Talent-management ATS whose career sites are hosted at `https://careers-page.clearcompany.com/jobs/{slug}/...`. Ever Jobs reads the **verified public careers feed**.

- **Method**: GET `https://careers-page.clearcompany.com/api/v1/careers/jobs` with an `API-ShortName: {slug}` header — returns the tenant's full open-roles list in a single call (no auth, no pagination envelope)
- **Auth**: None
- **Data Format**: JSON — flat array of PascalCase objects (`Id` GUID, `PositionTitle`, `Description` HTML, `OpenDate` ISO, `DepartmentName`, `OfficeName` free-text location, `ApplyUrl`, `OrganizationName`); dedup by job GUID via a `Set`
- **Tenant Resolution**: slug from `companySlug` or the `companyUrl` `/jobs/{slug}` path segment; unknown tenants return HTTP 400 and are handled gracefully as empty
- **Known Limitation**: WAF-gated tenants, server-side keyword/location filtering, structured-office lookup, and per-job detail enrichment (descriptions already in the feed) are non-goals (Spec 300)

---

## Architecture

Each ATS integration is an independent NestJS package following the `IScraper` interface:

```
packages/source-ats-{name}/
  src/
    index.ts              # Public exports
    {name}.module.ts      # NestJS module
    {name}.service.ts     # IScraper implementation
    {name}.constants.ts   # API URLs, headers
    {name}.types.ts       # Response type definitions
```

All ATS services are registered in `JobsService.ATS_SITES` and included in the scraper map, ensuring they run automatically when `companySlug` is provided.

---

## Adding a New ATS Integration

See [PRD_NEW_JOB_SOURCES.md](PRD_NEW_JOB_SOURCES.md) for the step-by-step guide to implementing a new source. The key steps are:

1. Create `packages/source-ats-{name}/` with the standard file structure
2. Implement the `IScraper` interface in the service
3. Add the `Site` enum entry in `packages/models/src/enums/site.enum.ts`
4. Register the path in `tsconfig.base.json`
5. Import the module in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.module.ts` and `apps/cli/src/cli.module.ts`
6. Wire it into `JobsService` (constructor, scraper map, `ATS_SITES` set)
