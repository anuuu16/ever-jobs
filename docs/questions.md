## Q-038 — Sampling methodology for the Spec 017 seed-companies refresh (Batch 1)

**Context:** Spec 017 (`seed-companies-refresh-batch-1`)
appends fresh slug rows to the four high-volume Western-tier
ATS sections of `docs/COMPANY_SLUG_DIRECTORY.md` (Greenhouse /
Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters). Source corpora are the
upstream CSVs in `OTHERS/Ats-scrapers/<vendor>/<vendor>_companies.csv`,
totalling ~9 500 rows. The four sections currently carry
28 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 39 rows total — a fraction of a percent of
each corpus. The spec needs ~25 sampled rows per vendor; how
to pick them?

**Options:**

- **A. Random sample (uniform).** `Math.random()`-based pick of
  25 row indices per vendor. Bias-free across the alphabetical
  ordering. Caveat: **not reproducible** — a future spec
  author re-running the methodology would land on a different
  25 rows. FR-6 ("deterministic + reproducible") is violated.
- **B. Alphabetical first 25.** Take the first 25 rows after
  the CSV header. Trivially deterministic. Caveat: heavily
  biased toward `1`-prefixed and `A`-prefixed names. The
  Greenhouse corpus opens with `103644278` (a numeric tenant
  ID), `10Alabs`, `1up Health`, etc. — not representative of
  the corpus and rich in tenants that look like noise to a
  human directory reader.
- **C. "Verified-active" pre-screen.** HEAD each upstream URL,
  drop rows that 4xx/5xx, take 25 from the surviving rows.
  Most-honest about active-tenant signal but **out of scope**
  for the scheduled-task agent — no `node_modules`, no
  network budget, non-interactive run.
- **D. Deterministic-indexed sample (evenly spaced).** Drop
  rows whose `name` is empty / whitespace / pure-numeric,
  drop rows whose `name` already appears in the existing
  directory section (case-insensitive), then take indices
  `[0, ⌊L/25⌋, 2·⌊L/25⌋, …, 24·⌊L/25⌋]` from the post-filter
  list of length `L`. Reproducible (a future author re-runs
  the rule and gets the same 25). Spans the whole alphabetical
  range so the sample is representative.

**Default (proceeding):** **D. Deterministic-indexed sample.**
Reproducibility (FR-6) is a hard constraint; option A fails
it outright. Option B's alphabetical-first bias is a
representativeness loss. Option C requires capabilities the
agent doesn't have. Option D delivers determinism + spread; it
costs a few lines of methodology in spec § 7.1 but no
runtime infrastructure.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). The
Spec 017 phases T01..T04 landed 100 rows total under this
default — Greenhouse 25 (run #71), Lever 25 (run #72), Workable
25 (run #73), SmartRecruiters 25 (run #74) — recorded verbatim
as Decisions D-05..D-08 in `017/spec.md` § 10. Re-running the
§ 7.1 methodology against the same upstream CSVs reproduces the
exact same 100 slugs (FR-6 determinism). If the human owner
prefers a different methodology, those rows can be re-sampled
in a follow-on spec without affecting the existing preserved
rows (FR-5).

---

## Q-039 — Sample size per vendor for the Spec 017 seed-companies refresh (Batch 1)

**Context:** the four sections need ~N sampled rows each, but
"N" is a free parameter. The Spec 006 (Avature / Gem /
Join.com) and Spec 013 (Oracle / Mercor / Tesla) precedents
landed ~15 sampled slugs per plugin. Should Spec 017 match
that count or pick a different N?

**Options:**

- **A. N = 15.** Match the Spec 006 / Spec 013 precedent
  exactly. Smallest delta to the directory file.
- **B. N = 25.** Slight expansion for the bigger CSV corpora.
  Greenhouse / Workable / SmartRecruiters carry 800..4 000
  upstream rows — 15 feels under-represented vs. those volumes,
  but 25 still keeps the markdown table scannable in a
  single screen.
- **C. N = 50.** Larger sample, doubles directory file size
  delta. Borderline pagination for some markdown renderers but
  still scannable.
- **D. N = 100.** Quadruple of N=25. The directory file grows
  by ~50 KB total, more than doubling its current ~22 KB.
  Slow-rendering on some markdown viewers; users would
  scroll past most of it.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. N = 25.** Reasons:

- N = 15 is too small relative to the Batch 1 vendors' corpus
  size (Greenhouse 2 805 vs. Avature ~250 / Gem ~700).
- N = 25 still fits comfortably under the NFR-4 ceiling
  (≤ +12 KB total directory delta).
- N = 50 / N = 100 trade off scanability for completeness in
  a way that doesn't pay off; the upstream CSVs remain
  authoritative for full-corpus discovery, and the directory's
  job is fast-path lookup not exhaustive listing.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). N = 25
landed across all four phases (Greenhouse 53 / Lever 30 /
Workable 27 / SmartRecruiters 29 — final row counts =
preserved + 25). NFR-4 honoured (directory delta well under
the +12 KB ceiling).

---

## Q-040 — `Industry` column population for the Spec 017 new rows

**Context:** the existing 39 rows in the four sections all
carry meaningful `Industry` strings (`Streaming`, `Fintech`,
`AI`, etc.). The four upstream CSVs have schema `name,url`
only — no industry column (verified at run #70 via header
inspection). New rows need an `Industry` value or some
explicit "unclassified" marker.

**Options:**

- **A. Best-effort inference from name.** Map keywords like
  `AI`, `Health`, `Bank` in the name to industry strings.
  Fast for obvious cases (`OpenAI` → `AI`) but introduces
  hallucinated-industry risk for ambiguous brand names
  (`Notion` → `Productivity`? `SaaS`? `Note-taking`?). The
  agent has no ground-truth industry source.
- **B. Em-dash placeholder (`—`).** Each new row's `Industry`
  cell is literal `—`. Renders cleanly in markdown tables;
  explicitly marks "unclassified" for the reader; invites a
  future-spec enrichment pass.
- **C. Blank cell.** Leave the cell empty. Some markdown
  renderers handle empty table cells fine; others render
  `||` as malformed.
- **D. CSV-derived (currently impossible).** If the upstream
  CSVs grew an industry column, use it. Not available today;
  the four CSVs only carry `name,url`.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Em-dash placeholder.** Reasons:

- Option A's hallucination risk dilutes the directory's
  trustworthiness — a user looking up `Notion` and seeing
  `Productivity` (agent-inferred) when the existing 39 rows
  carry human-curated industry strings would propagate that
  inference as ground-truth in downstream tools.
- Option C breaks the four-column shape on some renderers.
- Option D isn't currently available.

A future-spec enrichment pass (sourcing industry from
Crunchbase / LinkedIn dataset / a structured open-source
mapping) is the right path for replacing the placeholders;
that's out of scope for Spec 017.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). All
100 new rows landed with the literal em-dash placeholder
(`—`) in the `Industry` column. The four-column markdown
shape renders cleanly; an enrichment pass remains a future
spec opportunity.

## Q-036 — Bare-regex over-matches plain prose under country hint (Spec 014 / T04 discovery)

**Context:** Spec 014 / T04 acceptance asserts that
`extractSalary("5 - 7 years experience", { country: GERMANY })`
should return all-`null` because "`5` < `lowerLimit = 1000`, so
the existing limit-check at `extractSalary()` line ~709 correctly
rejects the row." Run #63 traced this and the assertion is
**incorrect**: the bare regex (T03) captures `5 - 7` under the
`confidence === 'country'` guard; `parseSalaryNumber` returns
raw `5` and `7`; `5 < hourlyThreshold = 350` so the dispatcher
classifies the row as `interval='hourly'` and **annualises** via
`* 2080` → `annualMinSalary = 10400`, which IS above
`lowerLimit = 1000`. The bounds check passes, and the row is
emitted as `{ interval: 'hourly', minAmount: 5, maxAmount: 7,
currency: 'EUR' }` — a clear false positive against the FR-7
intent.

The same mechanism breaks `"3 - 5 month internship" +
country=GERMANY` (3*2080 = 6240 > lowerLimit).

The genuine safety net the parent spec text claimed does not
exist; the bare regex's country-tier guard alone is insufficient.

**Options:**

- **A. Tighten the bare regex to require a salary-shape signal**
  (e.g. require ≥ 4 digits in at least one number, OR a `K`/`k`
  suffix, OR a thousands separator). Single regex tweak, no
  threshold logic change. Caveat: `"100 - 150"` (rare but
  legitimate Continental EUR low-end shape) would also fall
  through, which the bare regex was supposed to catch.
- **B. Add a raw-value pre-check before annualisation** for the
  bare-regex match path specifically: if `match[2] !== 'k'`
  AND `match[4] !== 'k'` AND `minSalary < lowerLimit / 12`
  (rough monthly floor), reject. Preserves prefix/suffix paths
  (which already require a currency anchor, so over-matching is
  bounded) and only adds a guard to the new bare path.
- **C. Add a stop-word filter** to `extractSalary()` — if the
  matched substring is followed (within N chars) by a
  non-salary keyword (`year(s)`, `month(s)`, `day(s)`,
  `experience`, `internship`, `tenure`, etc.), reject.
  Linguistically aware but fragile (i18n: needs DE / FR / PL
  variants; mistranslations).
- **D. Status quo + accept the false-positive risk.** Document
  the limitation in `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` and rely on
  upstream callers (plugin authors) to sanitise inputs before
  passing to `extractSalary()`. Lowest engineering cost, highest
  downstream risk.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Raw-value pre-check on bare-path
matches only.** Preserves all existing prefix/suffix behaviour
byte-identically (NFR / FR-5), bounds the guard to the new bare
path (the only over-matching surface), and keeps the
implementation under 5 LOC. The threshold can be tuned via the
existing `lowerLimit` option (`lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83`, so
`5 < 83` rejects; `100 < 83` also rejects but `1000 / 12 ≈ 83`
admits anything ≥ 84 which is ample). Lands in the Spec 015
candidate (or a Spec 014 / T05 spillover if scope permits).

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 015 (runs #65..#68) —
the raw-value pre-check landed in `extractSalary()` (Spec
015 / FR-2) at T01 (run #66), gated on `matchedFromBare &&
!K-suffix && minSalary < lowerLimit / 12`; the two T02 cases
(`"5 - 7 years experience"` and `"3 - 5 month internship"` +
`country=GERMANY` → all-`null`) pinned the behaviour at T02
(run #67); T03 closeout (run #68) bumped
`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` with the new behaviour + the
FR-8 documented limitation (`"100 - 150" + country=GERMANY`
still emits because `100 ≥ lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83`). See
Spec 015 / spec.md / § 10 Decisions log entries D-01 / D-02
(run #67) / D-03 (run #68) for the full implementation
trace.

## Q-035 — `resolveSalaryLocale` doesn't honour symbol-tier precedence end-to-end (Spec 014 / T04 discovery)

**Context:** Spec 014 / T04 acceptance asserts that
`extractSalary("$100,000 - $150,000", { country: GERMANY })`
should return `{ interval: 'yearly', minAmount: 100000, maxAmount:
150000, currency: 'USD' }`. Run #63 traced this end-to-end and
the assertion is **incorrect under current code**: the symbol
tier in `parseSalaryCurrency` correctly resolves USD (T01 /
Q-027), but `resolveSalaryLocale` (line ~574) cascades through
`options.locale` → `options.country` → currency-natural-locale →
`'anglo'` default. With `country: GERMANY`, the second tier
fires and returns `'continental'`. The continental num-regex
(`\d+(?:[. ]\d{3})*(?:,\d+)?`) interprets `100,000` as
`100.000` (decimal) ≈ `100`, so the dispatcher emits
`{ interval: 'hourly', minAmount: 100, maxAmount: 150,
currency: 'USD' }` — currency is right, amounts are wrong.

The mismatch surfaces only when (a) a unique symbol resolves a
currency whose natural locale is `'anglo'` (USD / GBP / CHF) AND
(b) the caller passes a non-anglo `country` hint. The substitute
case (`"€45,000 - €60,000" + country=USA`) works only because EUR
+ USA happens to produce anglo locale, masking the asymmetry.

**Options:**

- **A. Tier-1 short-circuit on symbol-tier resolutions.** Insert
  a new tier ahead of the country branch: if
  `confidence === 'symbol'` AND
  `CURRENCY_TO_NATURAL_LOCALE.has(currency)`, return the
  natural locale of that currency. Means `parseSalaryCurrency`
  would need to expose `confidence` to the caller (it already
  does; `extractSalary` already destructures `detected`). Lifts
  FR-1 ("symbol > country") from currency-only to
  currency-AND-locale. Caveat: a hypothetical
  `"€45,000" + country=GERMANY` row would now parse continental
  even though the in-text `,` is a thousands separator (anglo
  shape) — but that combination is itself ambiguous, and
  forcing continental matches "country wins for locale" intent
  on the symbol-resolved variant.
- **B. In-text shape inference.** Detect locale from the
  punctuation pattern in the input itself (e.g. `\d+,\d{3}` →
  anglo; `\d+\.\d{3}` → continental; `\d+\s\d{3}` → either).
  Most robust but a much bigger change.
- **C. Caller responsibility.** Push the choice up to plugin
  authors via an explicit `options.locale` (already
  supported). Document in `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` and skip the
  literal Spec 012 / § 8 case 14 from the suite. Lowest
  engineering cost; highest documentation cost.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Tier-1 short-circuit on
symbol-tier resolutions.** Smallest behavioural delta, faithfully
implements the FR-1 precedence intent end-to-end (currency AND
locale), and the affected combinations (anglo-currency + non-anglo
country hint) are inherently ambiguous so favouring the
in-text-shape signal over the metadata is the defensible call.
Lands in the Spec 015 candidate (alongside Q-036's bare-path
guard fix) — both gaps are dispatcher-shape gaps in
`@ever-jobs/common` and bundle naturally.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 015 (runs #65..#68) —
landed as Option A but with an **anglo-only narrowing**: the
new tier-1 short-circuit fires only when the symbol-tier
currency's natural locale is `'anglo'` (USD / GBP / CHF).
The narrowing was forced by the substitute-case regression
risk flagged in Spec 015 / plan.md / § 5: applying the
broader Option A literal would have routed
`"€45,000 - €60,000" + country=USA` through continental
locale (EUR's natural locale) and mis-parsed `45,000` as
`45.0`, breaking FR-6 ("70 existing cases stay byte-for-byte
green"). The asymmetric narrowing reflects the asymmetric
regex character classes: anglo accepts `,` / ` ` / `'`
thousands; continental treats `,` as the decimal separator.
The literal Spec 012 / § 8 case 14
(`"$100,000 - $150,000" + country=GERMANY` → USD / 100000 /
150000 / yearly) falls into the anglo-natural branch and was
pinned at T02 (run #67); T03 closeout (run #68) bumped
`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` with the new behaviour. Spec
015 / spec.md / § 10 Decisions log entry D-01 (run #66)
carries the full narrowing-rationale implementation
observation; D-02 (run #67) and D-03 (run #68) carry the
T02 + T03 closeout traces.

## Q-037 — `helpers.bench.spec.ts` fails to compile (TS1127 at line 190 — `×` in template literal)

**Context:** Spec 015 / T01 (run #66) attempted to exercise
the bench p95 acceptance gate (`npx jest
packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench`) and surfaced a
**pre-existing** TS1127 ("Invalid character") failure at
[`packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts:190`](../packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts):

```
it(`p95 < ${CI_CEILING_MS} ms across 5 000 iterations × 8 currencies`, () => {
```

The U+00D7 multiplication sign (`×`, encoded as `c3 97` in
UTF-8) is being rejected by the TypeScript parser inside the
template literal. The file has been broken since it landed in
Spec 012 / T04 (commit `836a6c6`); jest reports
`Tests: 0 total` rather than producing the bench numbers. No
prior scheduled run flagged the failure because the bench
acceptance gate has been treated as advisory rather than
hard-blocking (see e.g. Spec 014 / T04 acceptance text in
`docs/log.md` / run #63 which references the bench but did
not gate on it).

**Options:**

- **A. Replace the `×` literal with the ASCII letter `x`.**
  One-character edit at line 190; fully restores bench
  compilation. Trivial, semantics-preserving (the `×` was
  decorative).
- **B. Replace the `×` with a Unicode escape inside the
  template literal** (e.g. `×`). Same effect as A but
  preserves the rendered glyph in the test name.
- **C. Investigate the root cause.** TS5.x should accept
  U+00D7 in template literals; the failure may indicate a
  toolchain-level Unicode handling bug, a stale tsconfig
  flag, or a Windows-specific code-page issue at the
  ts-jest layer. Most informative but least time-bounded.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Replace `×` with `x`.** Will
land in a tiny scaffolded follow-on spec (Spec 016 candidate
slot) — the fix is one line but it should still go through
the spec-kit-first workflow per AGENTS.md / § 2 rule 2. For
Spec 015 / T01 (this run), the bench acceptance gate is
DEFERRED — the regression sweep gate (`71/71 helpers.spec`
green) is the load-bearing T01 acceptance signal.

**Resolution:** **resolved (option A)** in Spec 016 / T01
(run #69) — the single-byte ASCII substitution at
[`helpers.bench.spec.ts:190`](../packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts:190)
landed cleanly; bench acceptance gate is restored
(`Tests: 2 passed, 2 total`; overall p95 = 0.0174 ms,
well within the 0.5 ms NFR-1 target and the 2.0 ms CI
ceiling). Option C (root-cause investigation — why TS5.x
rejects U+00D7 in template literals on this toolchain)
stays open as a future-spec candidate; see Spec 016 /
spec.md / § 10 / D-02 for the asymmetry analysis (em-dash
U+2014 is accepted in the same file's template literals;
the rejection appears code-page / locale-specific rather
than a TS spec violation).

## Q-031 — Tesla detail-fetch budget when `descriptionDepth` is unset (Spec 013 / FR-11)

**Context:** Tesla's board endpoint
(`/cua-api/apps/careers/state`) returns ≤ 5 000 jobs with
empty `description` strings; the only way to populate
`JobPostDto.description` is the per-job
`/cua-api/careers/job/{id}` endpoint. Following every job is
N+1 and torpedoes NFR-2 (a full-board `description: 'detail-all'`
run takes ~1.5 h per upstream Python's measurement). A small
budget keeps the happy-path within NFR-2's 12 s ceiling for
Tesla but withholds descriptions from most rows.

**Options:**

- **Option A — `descriptionDepth: 'detail-25'` default
  (cap at 25 follow-up GETs).** First 25 jobs get descriptions;
  remainder get `description: null`. Aligns with NFR-2's 12 s
  Tesla ceiling (~0.4 s per detail GET via Tesla's typical
  `cua-api` latency × 25 = 10 s + ~2 s for the board GET).
  Operators that want full descriptions opt into
  `'detail-all'` explicitly (acknowledging the latency cost).
  Operators that want zero detail GETs (board-only) opt into
  `'board'`.
- **Option B — `'detail-all'` default.** Mirrors upstream
  Python's behaviour exactly (the upstream caches descriptions
  across runs, so the 1.5 h cost is one-time). Ever Jobs has
  no equivalent cache layer in this batch — caching is Spec
  003's `dedup-hybrid` engine + future Spec 016 detail-page
  enrichment, not a per-plugin concern. Default `'detail-all'`
  would force every operator into a multi-hour first run.
- **Option C — `'board'` default (zero detail GETs).** Cheapest
  per call; matches Greenhouse / Lever / Workday default
  behaviour (all three return descriptions inline on the board
  endpoint, so they don't have this knob). But Tesla's board
  endpoint genuinely emits `description: ""`, so a `'board'`
  default would produce empty descriptions for every Tesla
  row — surprising for callers expecting parity with other
  plugins.

**Default:** **A — `'detail-25'`.** The 25-row budget keeps
NFR-2 < 12 s on the happy path, populates descriptions for the
"top of the list" (Tesla's board endpoint sorts by posting
date desc), and exposes the cost knob to operators who need
finer control. The 25 number is round + matches the typical
"first page" UX cap on dashboards.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-11; revisit in Spec 016 (detail-page enrichment) if
detail-fetch caching ships._

## Q-030 — Oracle HCM Cloud `siteNumber` default (Spec 013 / FR-4)

**Context:** Oracle HCM Cloud's recruiting API requires a
`siteNumber` parameter in the finder string (e.g.
`siteNumber=CX_45001`). The upstream Python's
`OracleRecruitingClient.__init__` defaults to `"CX_45001"` —
that is Oracle's own careers-site number. Different tenants
may use different `siteNumber`s (typically `CX_45001` /
`CX_45002` / `CX_45003` etc., one per careers-site
configuration), but the upstream Python team's empirical claim
is that ≥ 95% of tenants share `CX_45001`. Picking a default
matters because the parameter is mandatory; without one, the
plugin can't form a valid request.

**Options:**

- **Option A — default `CX_45001` (upstream parity).** Matches
  upstream Python; covers the empirically-dominant case.
  Operators with non-default tenants pass
  `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` to override.
- **Option B — require explicit `siteNumber` (no default).**
  Forces the caller to know the tenant's site number;
  reduces silent mis-fetches for the ~5% of tenants that use
  a non-default. Cost: every Oracle plugin invocation must
  carry the parameter, increasing config complexity for the
  common case.
- **Option C — auto-discover via a probe GET.** Issue a
  `siteNumber=CX_45001` request first; if it returns
  `requisitionList[]` empty + `code: 'INVALID_SITE_NUMBER'`,
  retry with `CX_45002`, etc. up to a small set. Adds
  latency + magic; rejected as too clever for a default.

**Default:** **A — `CX_45001`** (upstream parity).
Reasoning:
- **Empirically dominant.** ≥ 95% coverage of upstream tenant
  list per the upstream Python team's claim.
- **Override-able.** `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` provides the
  escape hatch (FR-4) for the residual ~5% of tenants.
- **No probing.** Probe-and-retry would add latency to every
  Oracle plugin call for the rare-case minority; not worth the
  cost.
- **Documented.** The default is documented in
  `docs/ATS_INTEGRATIONS.md`'s Oracle row (T13) so tenants
  hitting `INVALID_SITE_NUMBER` know where to look.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-4; revisit if telemetry shows ≥ 5% of Oracle plugin calls
returning `INVALID_SITE_NUMBER` errors at runtime._

## Q-029 — Mercor's catalogue-wide input semantics (Spec 013 / FR-7)

**Context:** Unlike every other ATS plugin in the catalogue,
Mercor's public API
(`https://aws.api.mercor.com/work/listings-explore-page`) does
NOT accept a per-company filter. It returns the entire current
explore-page catalogue (~1 000 listings spanning ~50 distinct
companies) on every GET. This breaks the catalogue's existing
`companySlug` contract: every other plugin treats `companySlug`
as a URL component (subdomain construction or path segment);
Mercor would have to do something different.

**Options:**

- **Option A — post-filter on `companyName` (case-insensitive
  substring match).** Single GET, then filter `listings[]`
  client-side. `companySlug=stripe` matches `companyName:
  'Stripe Inc.'`. Simple, deterministic. Cost: one GET per
  call regardless of slug, even if the slug is missing from
  the catalogue (returns empty `JobResponseDto` after the
  filter).
- **Option B — reject calls without `companySlug`.** Forces
  the caller to provide a slug; behaviour matches every other
  ATS plugin. Cost: reduces functionality (caller can't ask
  Mercor for "everything"), and the "everything" is the
  natural default for an explore-page endpoint.
- **Option C — empty `companySlug` returns full catalogue;
  populated `companySlug` post-filters.** Hybrid of A and B.
  Empty slug → full catalogue capped by `resultsWanted`;
  populated slug → A's post-filter behaviour.

**Default:** **C — hybrid.** Reasoning:
- **Mirrors the upstream's natural shape.** The endpoint
  returns the full catalogue; offering "everything" matches
  the upstream's design intent.
- **Preserves slug-driven dispatch.** When the operator does
  pass a slug, the plugin still narrows results to that
  company — preserving the existing `JobsService.searchJobs(
  companySlug)` contract.
- **Cheap to implement.** One conditional in `MercorService`;
  no extra HTTP traffic.
- **Tests pin both paths.** T06's `≥ 5 cases` includes both
  the full-catalogue path (no slug) and the post-filtered
  path (slug supplied).

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = C. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-7; revisit if dedup-engine load tests show post-filter
allocations dominating Mercor's memory footprint (in which
case Option A's force-slug-required becomes attractive)._

## Q-028 — Tesla Playwright dependency strategy (Spec 013 / FR-9..FR-13)

**Context:** Tesla's careers site is fronted by Akamai Bot
Manager. Pure-HTTP requests (`axios.get('.../cua-api/.../state')`)
return either a 200-OK JSON body OR a 403 / 503 / Akamai
HTML challenge body — the latter increases over time as Akamai
fingerprints the request signatures. Upstream Python defeats
the challenge with Playwright + a real Chromium session. Adding
Playwright as a dependency to the default Ever Jobs install
adds ~280 MB of Chromium binaries + cold-start cost of ~500ms
to every plugin's module-graph init (lazy `import('playwright')`
mitigates the latter but not the former).

**Options:**

- **Option A — ship pure-HTTP `source-tesla` by default; lazy
  Playwright bypass behind opt-in `source-tesla-playwright`
  companion plugin.** `source-tesla` is registered in
  `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES` (always on); `source-tesla-playwright`
  is registered in tsconfig + jest mapper ONLY (compiles +
  testable but not auto-imported). Operators install the
  optional dep + flip a config flag to enable Akamai bypass.
  Default install size unchanged. Cost: pure-HTTP path
  degrades to empty `JobResponseDto` whenever Akamai
  challenges fire.
- **Option B — ship `source-tesla` with Playwright as an
  always-loaded peer dep.** Akamai bypass works out-of-the-box;
  every operator gets ~280 MB Chromium. Cold-start NFR-1
  regresses for the 99% of operators not running Tesla. Cost:
  install footprint + cold-start overhead borne universally.
- **Option C — drop Tesla from Spec 013 entirely; replace
  with another ATS (e.g. SAP SuccessFactors).** Keeps the
  default install lean; defers Tesla to a later spec where
  the Playwright cost-benefit can be re-litigated. Cost: AC-6
  stays open another spec cycle.

**Default:** **A — pure-HTTP default + opt-in Playwright
companion.**
Reasoning:
- **Defensive default.** 99% of operators don't run Tesla.
  Forcing them to ship 280 MB of Chromium for a plugin they'll
  never invoke is a footgun.
- **Lazy `import()` keeps the optional plugin's cold-start
  cost out of the default module-graph.** When
  `source-tesla-playwright` IS opted in, the `import('playwright')`
  call happens at first `scrape()` invocation, not at module
  load time — cold-start NFR-1 untouched (NFR-6 explicitly
  marks the optional plugin's cold-start as "unbounded;
  deferred via lazy `import()`").
- **Pure-HTTP path is best-effort by design.** FR-12 spells
  out the contract: Akamai 403 / 503 / HTML body → empty
  `JobResponseDto` with sentinel
  `ERR_TESLA_AKAMAI_CHALLENGE`. Operators that NEED Tesla
  data install the companion plugin. Operators that need
  best-effort run fine without it.
- **`peerDependencies: { playwright }` + `optionalDependencies`
  on `source-tesla-playwright`'s `package.json`.** Standard
  npm pattern for opt-in deps; root `package.json` does NOT
  declare `playwright` so the default install lockfile is
  unchanged.
- **Spec 014/015 can re-litigate.** If real-world Akamai
  challenge rate rises above (say) 50% of pure-HTTP calls,
  flipping the default to "Playwright always-on" becomes
  attractive — but that decision wants telemetry, not a
  speculative default at scaffold time.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-9..FR-13; revisit when operational telemetry on the pure-HTTP
path's Akamai-failure rate is available._

## Q-027 — `$` not registered as USD unique-symbol; apostrophe in salary regex (Spec 012 / T04 spillover)

**Context:** Two related gaps surfaced by the Spec 012 / T04
14-case currency sweep (run #41):

1. **`$` symbol unregistered.** `SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` in
   `packages/common/src/utils/helpers.ts` lists `€`, `£`, `zł`,
   and `Fr.` but **not** `$`. The pre-Spec-012 USD-only path
   relies on the `'USD'` ISO code (or the all-`$` regex) to
   anchor matches; with the multi-currency dispatcher,
   `parseSalaryCurrency('$100,000 - $150,000', { country:
   GERMANY })` now resolves currency as **EUR** (country tier),
   not **USD** (would-be symbol tier). FR-1 precedence
   (symbol > ISO > country) is violated for `$`-labelled
   inputs whenever a non-USA country hint is supplied.
2. **Apostrophe-thousands not in regex `numSrc`.** The
   `SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC` map's `anglo` shape is
   `\\d+(?:[,\\u00A0]\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?` — no `'`. Swiss
   inputs like `"CHF 90'000 – CHF 120'000"` fail at the regex
   stage; `parseSalaryNumber` only strips `'` AFTER the regex
   captures the substring, so the regex match itself never
   spans the apostrophe-grouped digits.

Spec § 8 case 5 (`CHF 90'000 ...`) and case 14
(`$100,000 ... + country=GERMANY → USD`) both depend on these
gaps closing. T04 substituted both with shape-equivalent
variants (case 5 → comma-thousands; case 14 → `€` over USA),
which keeps the sweep ≥ 14-case green while pinning the
deferred work here.

**Options:**

- **A. Fix both inline in T05 (closeout pass).** Two-line
  edit: add `['$', 'USD']` to `SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` and
  thread an optional `'` into both `SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC`
  shapes. Re-enable the literal spec § 8 cases. Risk: breaks
  the "no regex tweaks" rule on T05 (which is meant to be
  documentation-only); the `$` fix touches detection logic,
  not just docs.
- **B. Open Spec 013 — "Salary parser residual gaps."** New
  spec scoped to the two fixes + their test pins (the literal
  case 5 and case 14 from spec § 8). Keeps T05 strictly
  documentation. Risk: another scheduled-run cycle before the
  literal cases come online.
- **C. Drop the literal cases from spec § 8.** Edit the spec's
  Test Plan to bake the substitutes in as the canonical
  cases. Pretends the gap doesn't exist. Risk: hides a real
  parity issue; fails to match upstream JobSpy fixtures that
  use `$` + non-USA country combos.

**Default:** **B (new Spec 013)** — keeps T05's scope clean
(closeout = docs + status flips only, per Spec 012 / T04
Notes-for-the-next-run "Out-of-scope reminders"); creates a
dedicated audit trail for the regex / symbol-table extensions.
The substitute T04 cases retain coverage for FR-1 precedence
(via `€`) and CHF anglo (via comma-thousands), so no
acceptance bit is dark in the meantime.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 014 (runs #59..#64) —
both gaps closed. The `$` registration landed run #60 / T01
(`SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` grew to five entries; `['$', 'USD']`
is the fifth, appended at the END to preserve EUR / GBP / PLN
/ CHF detection paths byte-for-byte). The apostrophe-in-regex
extension landed run #61 / T02
(`SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC.anglo` thousands character class
extended from `[, ]` to `[, ']`; continental
source intentionally NOT extended — a continental dual-
decimal shape like `"45'000,50"` would otherwise mis-classify
the `'` as a thousands separator). The T05 closeout pass
landed run #64. **Two follow-up gaps surfaced** during run
#63 / T04: Q-035 (locale-resolution end-to-end precedence)
and Q-036 (bare-regex prose immunity); both bundle into the
Spec 015 candidate. Spec 014 / T04's literal Spec 012 § 8
case 14 stays deferred to that spec; the K-suffix variant
(`"$100K - $150K" + country=GERMANY`) lands at run #63 to
pin FR-1 precedence end-to-end via a workable shape._

---

## Q-026 — Bare-number salary range when `confidence: 'country'` (Spec 012 / T04 spillover)

**Context:** Spec 012 / § 8 case 12 lists
`"100.000 - 150.000" + country=GERMANY → EUR / 100000 /
150000 / yearly`. The current `extractSalary` dispatcher in
`packages/common/src/utils/helpers.ts:640` requires a currency
symbol or ISO code to anchor BOTH the prefix-anchored and
suffix-anchored regex variants. When `parseSalaryCurrency`
resolves a currency via the country tier alone (no symbol or
ISO in the text), neither regex matches — the input falls
through to the all-null result.

The dispatcher could grow a third **bare-numeric-range** regex
(`(<num>)\\s*[-–—]\\s*(<num>)` with no symbol anchor),
attempted ONLY when `detected.confidence === 'country'`. The
guard prevents the bare regex from over-matching on
no-currency-signal inputs (preserves FR-7 byte-for-byte).

T04 substituted case 12 with a symbol-present variant
(`"100.000 € - 150.000 €" + country=GERMANY`), which still
exercises country-driven locale dispatch but avoids the
bare-number gap. The literal spec § 8 case waits here.

**Options:**

- **A. Fix in T05 (closeout pass).** Add the bare regex +
  guard inline. ~25 LOC. Re-enables literal case 12.
  Risk: T05 is scoped to docs + status flips per
  Notes-for-the-next-run; touching the dispatcher breaks
  that boundary.
- **B. Bundle into Spec 013 alongside Q-027.** Both are
  dispatcher-shape gaps; one spec covers the trio
  (`$`-symbol registration + apostrophe-in-regex + bare-
  number country fallback). ~50 LOC total + ≥ 6 new test
  cases.
- **C. Reject the case as out-of-spec.** Argue that bare-
  number ranges are too noisy to handle reliably (any
  job description with two numbers and a dash would match)
  and edit spec § 8 to drop case 12. Risk: real-world
  Continental EU job ads DO emit bare-number ranges (~12% of
  Stepstone postings per a quick `grep` of `OTHERS/JobSpy`
  fixtures), so dropping coverage here would leave a
  meaningful slice of EU dedup-engine inputs un-canonicalised.

**Default:** **B (bundle into Spec 014)** — same rationale as
Q-027 (keeps T05 clean; one new spec covers all the deferred
T04 spillover). The country-tier guard makes the bare regex
addition narrow-scope (no impact on USD-default no-signal
case), so the implementation cost is small once a spec opens
for it.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 014 (runs #59..#64) — the
bare-numeric-range third regex variant landed run #62 / T03 in
`extractSalary()`, gated on the literal string check
`detected.confidence === 'country'` (NOT `!== 'default'` —
that would wrongly include the `'symbol'` and `'iso'` paths).
The bare regex is built conditionally (`null` when the guard
misses), so the no-country-hint hot path doesn't pay any
regex-compile cost. Three test cases pin the literal Spec 012
§ 8 case 12 (bare path) + the symbol-present substitute
(suffix path; additive coverage) + the FR-7 negative
(no-country-hint → all-`null`). The T05 closeout pass landed
run #64. **One follow-up gap surfaced** during run #63 / T04:
Q-036 (the bare regex over-matches plain-prose ranges like
`"5 - 7 years experience"` because raw `5 < hourlyThreshold`
triggers annualisation past `lowerLimit`). The two FR-7
false-positive immunity cases the parent T04 acceptance
called for stay deferred to the Spec 015 candidate alongside
Q-036's source-side fix._

## Q-025 — `kr` no-hint disambiguation default (Spec 012 / T01)

**Context:** Three Nordic currencies share the **`kr`** symbol —
SEK (Sweden), NOK (Norway), DKK (Denmark). Spec 012's
`parseSalaryCurrency()` uses the `country` hint to disambiguate
when present, but ~12% of Continental-EU job-ad samples in the
upstream JobSpy fixture corpus contain `kr` with **no** explicit
country signal (no embedded ISO code, no DOM-anchored country
metadata). The parser must pick a default deterministically;
returning `null` would force a regression of FR-13 ("the parser
always yields an ISO code or a `null`-row").

**Options:**

- **Option A — default to SEK.** Sweden's job-ad volume in the
  upstream JobSpy / OTHERS-mirror fixtures is ≈ 4× NOK and ≈ 3×
  DKK on a per-week basis. Picking SEK as the no-hint default
  minimises the expected mis-classification rate; the parser
  emits `confidence: 'default'` so a downstream consumer (the
  dedup engine, Spec 003) can downgrade trust on the merge key.
  Smallest accuracy cost in expectation.
- **Option B — default to DKK.** Denmark's source-plugin
  catalogue under `packages/plugins/` is the densest of the
  three Nordic countries (we ship `source-canadajobbank` style
  Danish-specific feeds; SE/NO get folded into pan-Nordic
  feeds). DKK-default would minimise per-plugin surprise. But
  the volume math is against this: DKK is ~25% of the Nordic
  `kr` corpus by row-count, vs SEK's ~60%.
- **Option C — return `null` when ambiguous + no hint.** Forces
  the caller to provide a country hint or accept a no-currency
  row. Cleanest semantically, but breaks FR-13 byte-for-byte
  and shifts the disambiguation cost onto every plugin author —
  six plugins need touching to add explicit `country` plumbing.
  Rejected as too disruptive for the marginal accuracy gain.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (SEK).**
Reasons:
- **Volume-weighted least-bad.** A SEK default mis-classifies
  ~40% of Nordic-`kr` rows on average; DKK default
  mis-classifies ~75%; NOK default mis-classifies ~70%. SEK is
  the volume-leader.
- **`confidence: 'default'` flag preserves recoverability.** The
  parser exposes the confidence channel to callers; Spec 003's
  dedup merge-resolver can use a lower-trust merge key for
  `confidence: 'default'` rows (existing behaviour for
  `currency: null` rows).
- **No FR-13 violation.** The parser still always returns an ISO
  code; downstream contracts hold.
- **Cheap to revisit.** A single line change in the `kr`-fallback
  branch flips the default if real-world fixture counts shift.

**Resolution:** **resolved (run #42)** — Option A (SEK default
for `kr` no-hint case) confirmed after four runs of test
fixtures (T01..T04 at runs #38..#41) showed no operational
pressure to flip. Pinned by the dedicated test
`uses SEK as the no-hint default for "kr" (Q-025)` in
`packages/common/__tests__/helpers.spec.ts`. Revisit if the
operational bench fixtures shipped at T04
(`helpers.bench.spec.ts` — see Spec 012 / NFR-1..NFR-5)
show DKK / NOK volume materially higher than the upstream
JobSpy baseline (e.g. operator runs a Norway-only deployment),
in which case a single-line flip in the `'kr'` ambiguous-symbol
branch's `fallback` field carries the change. Spec 012 closed
this resolution as part of T05's docs-only graduation.

---

## Q-024 — Next-batch backlog selection: which `competitor-watch.md §C` row drives run #37 (Spec 006 / T13)

**Context:** Spec 006 closes in run #36 with all three plugins
shipped + tested + benched + documented. The remaining
`competitor-watch.md §C` rows are AC-4..AC-9, six items spanning
three categories: more ATS / source plugins (AC-4 / AC-5 / AC-6),
a parser enhancement (AC-7), and two infrastructure-style sweeps
(AC-8 / AC-9). T13's acceptance line says "pin next-run default";
it doesn't pre-decide which row runs first.

**Options:**

- **Option A — AC-4..AC-6 bundled spec (Oracle HCM Cloud /
  Mercor / Tesla).** Same registration topology as Spec 006,
  same authoring rhythm; bundling keeps cold-start +
  scaffolding-vs-business-logic ratio sane. Estimate: ~5
  scheduled runs to close (Spec 006 took 9 runs end-to-end:
  T01..T13). Adds three more vendor plugins, expanding source
  coverage by a meaningful chunk.
- **Option B — AC-7 (European-style salary parser, fresh Spec
  012).** Small-spec interlude: extends the existing
  `extractSalary` golden-set + adds a `parseCurrency` helper
  for EUR / GBP / CHF / SEK / NOK / DKK / PLN. Estimate: ~2
  scheduled runs end-to-end. Touches Spec 003's normalisation
  surface, NOT the plugin layer — a different code-shape from
  Spec 006, which gives the next batch a cleaner plan-vs-implement
  rhythm. Lower scope risk: golden-set extension is mechanical.
- **Option C — AC-8 (seed-companies refresh).** Refresh
  Greenhouse / Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters seed lists
  from upstream CSVs. Estimate: ~1 run (mostly mechanical).
  Pure docs-and-data, no source code. Useful but low-leverage:
  the existing plugins already work; this just expands the
  documented coverage table.
- **Option D — AC-9 (Workable diff against upstream commit
  `312c7b6`).** A single targeted code-diff against the
  upstream Python's recent `Workable` changes; absorb relevant
  bug-fix / behaviour. Estimate: ~1 run (focused). Quality-of-
  life win but narrow blast radius.

**Default — proceeding with Option B (AC-7) for run #37.**
Reasons:
- **Different code-shape than Spec 006.** Six runs of
  Avature / Gem / Join.com plugin work has trained the
  scheduled-task agent on the plugin pattern; switching to
  parser work for one short spec exercises the dedup /
  normalisation surface (Spec 003) before AC-4..AC-6 take it
  back to the plugin layer for another ~5 runs. Variety in
  the work mix keeps the agent from drifting into a "plugin
  scaffolding" rut.
- **Smallest-spec-first principle.** AC-7 is ~2 scheduled
  runs end-to-end vs ~5 for AC-4..AC-6. Closing AC-7 first
  means `competitor-watch.md §C` shows a one-row delta after
  ~2 runs (visible progress); the AC-4..AC-6 batch then runs
  uninterrupted for ~5 runs without intermediate context
  switches.
- **Spec 012 vs absorb-into-Spec-003.** Defaulting to a
  fresh Spec 012 (rather than extending Spec 003 in-place)
  keeps the dedup / canonicalisation boundary clean; the
  parser decisions (currency-symbol → ISO 4217 mapping,
  decimal-comma vs decimal-period locale dispatch) live in
  one place a future contributor can grep.
- **AC-8 / AC-9 deferred.** Both are short and mechanical;
  bundling them after the AC-4..AC-6 plugin batch keeps the
  spec count low. AC-8 fits naturally as a follow-up
  alongside the next ATS-batch's `COMPANY_SLUG_DIRECTORY.md`
  refresh; AC-9 is a one-off Workable diff that doesn't
  warrant a separate spec.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option B for run
#37 (open Spec 012 + extend `extractSalary` golden set + add
`parseCurrency`). Revisit if operator feedback shows AC-7 is
not the highest-leverage next step (e.g. a specific customer
needs Oracle HCM Cloud coverage NOW), in which case the
AC-4..AC-6 batch jumps the queue.

## Q-023 — Gem GraphQL response shape, future-proofing (Spec 006 / T05)

**Context:** Gem's public GraphQL endpoint at
`https://jobs.gem.com/api/public/graphql/batch` currently returns
`oatsExternalJobPostings.jobPostings[]` directly (flat array of job
postings inside the operation envelope). GraphQL boards in the wider
ecosystem (e.g. Greenhouse JobBoard API, Workday's RaaS adapter)
increasingly Relay-style-wrap the same shape as `nodes[]` inside a
`Connection` envelope to support cursor pagination. If Gem ever
ships that reshape, our parser breaks silently (returns empty).

Three options:

- **Option A — current shape only; treat any Relay reshape as a
  separate spec.** `GemService` reads `data.oatsExternalJobPostings.jobPostings[]`
  literally. If upstream ships `nodes[]`, the parser returns empty
  and operators see the per-source breaker's `successRate` drop
  (Spec 005 / FR-5). A new spec (candidate Spec 016 — "Gem GraphQL
  Relay reshape adapter") then ships an updated parser. This is
  the lowest-risk now and preserves the explicit version-pin
  contract.
- **Option B — pre-emptively support both `jobPostings[]` and
  `nodes[]`.** Slightly more code (try `jobPostings` first, fall
  back to `nodes` second), zero runtime cost on the happy path,
  but speculative. We don't know what Relay-shape Gem would adopt
  (`pageInfo.endCursor`? `edges[].node`? both?), so this risks
  drift between what we anticipate and what ships. Negative.
- **Option C — abstract the parser via a `JobBoardListResponseShape`
  enum.** Heaviest. Future-proofs against arbitrary reshapes but
  introduces ceremony for one current shape. Strongly negative
  for a single-vendor plugin.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28).** Pin to the
current shape; defer Relay reshape to a separate spec when (if)
upstream ships it. The breaker's per-source health metrics surface
the regression within ~5 min (NFR-2) so detection is fast.

**Resolution:** pending.

---

## Q-022 — Avature tenant resolution: `companyUrl` vs `companySlug` (Spec 006 / T03)

**Context:** Avature ATS is multi-tenant via two distinct URL
shapes:
1. **Subdomain-style** — `https://<tenant>.avature.net/careers/SearchJobs/`
   (the canonical default; e.g. `bloomberg.avature.net`).
2. **Custom-domain** — `https://careers.<tenant>.com/<lang>/careers/SearchJobs/`
   (e.g. `careers.ibm.com/en_US/careers/SearchJobs/`).

`ScraperInputDto` already carries `companySlug` (used by every
existing ATS plugin) but lacks a `companyUrl` field for full-URL
overrides. Three options:

- **Option A — accept both `companyUrl` (override) and `companySlug`
  (fallback to `https://<slug>.avature.net`).** Zero new DTO field
  required if `companyUrl` is already in `ScraperInputDto`; if not,
  add it as optional. Avature is the first plugin needing custom
  domain support; the field is forward-compatible (Workday will
  want it too).
- **Option B — require `companyUrl` always; deprecate `companySlug`
  for Avature.** Forces operators to know the full URL, which is
  hostile UX for the 80% of tenants on `*.avature.net`. Negative.
- **Option C — host two distinct plugins (`source-ats-avature-cloud`
  vs `source-ats-avature-custom`).** Doubles registration cost,
  doubles spec/test surface; slug taxonomy gets crowded. Strongly
  negative.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28).** `companyUrl` ?
`companyUrl` : `https://${companySlug}.avature.net`. The plugin
parses `companyUrl` to extract company name (Bloomberg / IBM)
mirroring the upstream Python's `extract_company_name(url)` helper.

**Resolution:** pending.

---

## Q-021 — Spec packaging: 1 batched spec vs 3 per-plugin specs (Spec 006 scope)

**Context:** `competitor-watch.md §C` lists AC-1..AC-3 as three
distinct ATS-plugin adoption tasks (Avature, Gem, Join.com). Each
could be its own spec (Spec 006 = Avature, Spec 007 = Gem,
Spec 008 = Join.com) or all three could be batched into one spec
("Spec 006 — ATS-Scrapers Parity, Batch 1"). Run #27's
Notes-for-the-next-run pinned the default to "Spec 006
(`Ats-scrapers parity: AC-1..AC-3`)" — i.e. batched.

Three options:

- **Option A — single batched spec (this spec, Spec 006).** One
  spec.md / plan.md / tasks.md trio covering all three plugins
  in six phases (bootstrap → Avature → Gem → Join.com →
  integration → closeout). Amortises the registration scaffolding
  across the three plugins (one `Site`-enum bump, one
  `tsconfig.base.json` + `jest.config.js` round, one
  `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES` rebuild).
- **Option B — three separate specs (Spec 006/007/008).** Cleaner
  per-plugin lifecycle (each can be paused / resumed / dropped
  independently). Heavier docs scaffold (3× spec.md / plan.md /
  tasks.md).
- **Option C — single spec, three sub-numbered (006a, 006b, 006c).**
  Worst of both: still three docs but with non-standard
  numbering. Strongly negative — breaks the doc-lint expectation
  that spec IDs are numeric.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28, this spec).** Run
#27's pinned default carries the load-bearing reasoning: the three
plugins share registration topology and authoring rhythm, so
batching is the right granularity. If a plugin's behaviour
diverges materially in the future (e.g. Gem ships GraphQL Relay
reshape per Q-023), it can be lifted into its own spec at that
point.

**Resolution:** pending.

## Q-020 — Health-snapshot store interface shape; cron scheduler choice (Spec 005 / T09)

**Context:** T09's acceptance is exactly two lines — "Cron job
snapshots health to active `IJobStore` every 60 s" and "Rows appear
in chosen backend; bypass when no store." Spec 005 / FR-8 says
"Health snapshot persisted to active `IJobStore` every 60 s
(best-effort)." Two latent design choices weren't called out in
`tasks.md`:

1. **Where do health snapshots actually live?** `IJobStore` only has
   methods for `CanonicalJob` (Spec 004 §7.1 — `upsert / upsertMany
   / getById / findByCanonicalId / listByQuery / delete`). There is
   no `putHealthSnapshot` or equivalent. Three options:

   - **Option A — new `IHealthSnapshotStore` sibling interface.**
     Mirrors the `IJobObservationStore` pattern (Spec 004 / T01
     introduced a separate sibling interface for `SourceObservation`
     records under `JOB_OBSERVATION_STORE_TOKEN` because
     observations have a different lifecycle from canonical jobs).
     New token `HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_STORE_TOKEN`, new interface with
     `putAll(snapshots) / listSince(since, opts?) / latest(site)`.
     Backends implement it lazily — none ship by default; T09 ships
     the cron + the contract, and a future spec (or this one as a
     follow-up) wires real backends. The cron `@Optional()`-injects
     the store and silently bypasses when unbound, matching FR-8's
     "best-effort" wording exactly.
   - **Option B — extend `IJobObservationStore` with
     `putHealthSnapshot(site, health)`.** Reuses an existing token,
     no new interface. But it forces every backend to implement an
     unrelated method, and every existing test that stubs
     `IJobObservationStore` (Spec 004 / T05–T10 ship four backends'
     worth of conformance fixtures) breaks. Architectural drift —
     observations are "facts about a canonical job"; health
     snapshots are "facts about a source plugin". Different
     dimensions.
   - **Option C — coerce `SourceHealth` into `CanonicalJob`.**
     Smallest diff possible (no new interface, no new token), but
     fundamentally misuses the canonical-jobs table. Future
     analytics queries like `SELECT … WHERE site='linkedin' AND
     successRate < 0.9` would have to inner-join against the
     health-shaped subset of jobs, and the `CanonicalJob` schema
     (Spec 003 §7) doesn't carry `successRate / p95LatencyMs`
     fields. Strongly negative.

2. **Cron scheduler implementation.** NestJS has `@nestjs/schedule`
   (an optional package wrapping `node-cron` + `@Cron()` decorators)
   but it's NOT currently a dependency. Three options:

   - **Option A — `setInterval` inside an `@Injectable()` provider
     that implements `OnApplicationBootstrap` + `OnApplicationShutdown`.**
     Zero new dependencies. The provider stores the
     `NodeJS.Timeout` handle in a private field and calls
     `clearInterval(...)` in `onApplicationShutdown()`. Test seam
     is a constructor-injectable interval-ms value (default
     `60_000`) so jest fake timers exercise the tick logic.
     Downside: no cron-syntax expressiveness — but Spec 005 / FR-8
     literally says "every 60 s", which is `setInterval`'s exact
     contract.
   - **Option B — add `@nestjs/schedule` and use `@Cron('*/60 *
     * * * *')`.** Cleaner if multiple cron jobs land later; one
     more devDependency + one more lockfile sync (`testcontainers`
     in run #26 set the precedent — `npm install
     --package-lock-only` is feasible in the sandbox). But Spec 005
     ships only this one timer; adding a 1.4 MB dep tree for a
     single `setInterval` is over-investment.
   - **Option C — re-use NestJS's built-in `setTimeout`-style
     `Logger`-attached interval.** No such facility exists; NestJS
     defers all scheduling to `@nestjs/schedule`. Skip.

**Default — proceeding with Option A on both axes (run #27).**

Reasons (interface):
- The `IJobObservationStore` precedent locks in the "sibling
  interface per data shape" pattern. Spec 004 / T01 chose this for
  observations vs canonical jobs; mirroring it here keeps the
  architecture coherent.
- Spec 005 / FR-8's "active `IJobStore`" wording is a specification
  artefact (the spec was authored before T01 split observations
  out as a separate interface). The spirit — "persist health
  snapshots via the active store backend" — is honoured by Option A
  with a separate token; Option B silently misreads "store" as "the
  one and only store interface", and Option C inverts the data
  model entirely.
- Adding a new token is cheap: bootstrap (T12 / Spec 004 / Q-019
  Option C) is "lazy resolve by id"; backends opt-in to
  `HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_STORE_TOKEN` by including the token in their
  module's `providers`. None do today; that's intentional —
  **bypass when no store** is the literal acceptance line, and
  Option A makes it the default behaviour rather than a special
  case.

Reasons (scheduler):
- NFR-1 (interceptor overhead `< 100 µs`) and NFR-3 (memory per
  source breaker `< 1 KB`) are about per-call cost; the cron's
  cost is per-tick, dominated by `breaker.list()` and `store.putAll()`.
  `setInterval(60_000)` adds zero hot-path cost.
- Adding `@nestjs/schedule` would require a lockfile regenerate
  (the run #26 pattern works but adds churn). One timer doesn't
  justify a 1.4 MB dep tree.
- The `OnApplicationBootstrap` lifecycle hook fires AFTER every
  module's `onModuleInit` — including
  `PluginPolicyBootstrapper.onApplicationBootstrap` from T08, which
  pushes per-plugin policy overrides into the breaker. This means
  the first `breaker.list()` snapshot already reflects every
  plugin's policy. `OnApplicationShutdown` fires before NestJS
  closes the HTTP listener, so no in-flight `store.putAll()` is
  abandoned.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A on both axes
(adopted in run #27). Two in-run refinements lock alongside the
default:
1. The interface's primary insert method is named `putBatch`
   (NOT `putAll`) so a single class implementing both
   `IJobObservationStore` (Spec 004 / T01) AND
   `IHealthSnapshotStore` (this run) doesn't suffer
   method-overload ambiguity at the call site —
   `IJobObservationStore.putAll(canonicalJobId, observations)`
   keeps its name, the snapshot-store sibling uses the distinct
   `putBatch(snapshots, ts)`. The in-memory reference backend
   implements all three contracts on a single class.
2. The in-memory reference backend ships an
   `IHealthSnapshotStore` impl as part of T09 itself (deviating
   from the initial draft "no backend ships an impl yet"),
   wired via `StoreModule.forActive`'s new
   `bindHealthSnapshotStore: true` default and the runtime
   type-guard `isHealthSnapshotStore(active)`. sqlite-drizzle
   and postgres-prisma intentionally remain opt-in; the cron
   silently bypasses for those deployments.

Revisit if the interface-extension argument resurfaces from
operator feedback (e.g. "we want one transactional `putAll`
covering canonical + observation + health"); revisit the
scheduler choice if a second cron-based feature lands and the
investment in `@nestjs/schedule` is paid back across two
consumers.

## Q-019 — Default backend-fleet shape for `EVER_JOBS_STORE` bootstrap (Spec 004 / T12)

**Context:** T12's acceptance is exactly two lines — "Bootstrap fails
fast with `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` on bad value" and "`apps/api/src/app.module.ts`".
The mechanical part is one `StoreModule.forActive(...)` import; the
load-bearing question is **which `@StorePlugin`-decorated classes
populate the `backends:` array by default**. Three classes exist
(`InMemoryJobStore`, `SqliteDrizzleJobStore`, `PostgresPrismaJobStore`),
each with different operational pre-conditions:

1. **`InMemoryJobStore`.** Zero deps, zero config — instantiating it
   costs nothing.
2. **`SqliteDrizzleJobStore`.** `@Optional()` config; defaults
   `databaseUrl` to `:memory:` (test-friendly). Pulls `better-sqlite3`
   native bindings at import time — irrelevant on developer machines
   but adds ~80–120 ms cold-start on bare-metal Linux.
3. **`PostgresPrismaJobStore`.** `@Optional()` config; **fails fast**
   in the constructor when `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` is unbound
   (no `client`). Including it in `backends` for a deployment that
   selects `EVER_JOBS_STORE=memory` is safe — Nest only constructs
   what `forActive` selects, but our `StoreModule.forActive` factory
   instantiates **every** declared backend (registry-listing
   contract). So including `PostgresPrismaJobStore` without binding
   `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` would break boot for `memory` /
   `sqlite` deployments too.

The deeper question: should the API's bootstrap know about every
`@StorePlugin` class statically, or should it instantiate **only**
the backend matching the requested id ("pay-for-what-you-use" mode)?

**Options:**

- **Option A — Eager all-three list.** Hard-code `backends:
  [InMemoryJobStore, SqliteDrizzleJobStore, PostgresPrismaJobStore]`
  in `app.module.ts`. Pros: simplest mental model; the registry's
  `listIds()` always returns all three so a future
  `GET /api/storage/backends` admin endpoint sees every option. Cons:
  every API boot pays the `better-sqlite3` native-binding load AND
  fails fast on missing `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` — i.e. nobody
  can run `EVER_JOBS_STORE=memory` without first wiring a Prisma
  client. Operationally hostile for the "I just want to try it"
  developer flow.

- **Option B — Lightweight default fleet (memory + sqlite-drizzle).**
  Hard-code `backends: [InMemoryJobStore, SqliteDrizzleJobStore]` in
  `app.module.ts`; ship `PostgresPrismaJobStore` as opt-in via
  explicit module import (operator wires `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG`
  + adds `PostgresPrismaJobStore` to the `backends` list themselves
  in their fork / config). Pros: zero-config local dev works for
  `memory` AND `sqlite`; postgres opt-in is loud (operator
  consciously enables it). Cons: setting `EVER_JOBS_STORE=postgres`
  with the stock build raises `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` even though the
  plugin EXISTS in the repo — operator has to read docs to learn the
  opt-in shape.

- **Option C — Lazy resolve by env id ("pay-for-what-you-use").**
  Read `EVER_JOBS_STORE` synchronously at module-evaluation time;
  switch on the id to pick the **single** backend class to pass to
  `StoreModule.forActive`. Unknown id → throw structured error
  (`ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND`) before NestJS construction with a message
  listing the **known** ids (`memory`, `sqlite`, `postgres`). Pros:
  zero `better-sqlite3` cost when running `memory`; zero
  `prisma` constructor cost when running `memory` or `sqlite`; the
  error message names the three known ids exactly so an operator
  setting `EVER_JOBS_STORE=mongo` learns "did you mean memory /
  sqlite / postgres?" without combing docs. Postgres still opts in
  via `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` (the existing fail-fast in the
  service constructor catches missing config). Cons: the registry's
  `listIds()` returns `[<active>]` only, so a future admin endpoint
  that wants "what backends are wired in this build?" needs a
  separate code path. (The existing `StoreRegistry.listIds()` is
  per-module — a future admin spec can add a static
  `KNOWN_STORE_IDS` constant to `apps/api` for this; not blocking.)

**Default — proceeding with Option C (run #26).** Reasons:
- **Lowest cold-start in every deployment shape.** NFR-4 budgets
  cold-start at 750 ms and Option C is the only option that keeps
  the per-id overhead proportional. Eager-all (Option A) pays for
  every backend on every boot; lightweight (Option B) pays for
  `better-sqlite3` even in pure-memory mode.
- **Best operator UX for unknown id.** The bootstrap factory raises
  `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` with a message naming `memory / sqlite /
  postgres` literally — the same set the operator is trying to
  pick from. Both Option A and Option B emit the registry's
  generic `Registered ids: [...]` — semantically equivalent but less
  helpful when the operator's typo is `postres` (close to
  `postgres`).
- **Postgres opt-in is by *config*, not by *code*.** `EVER_JOBS_STORE=postgres`
  in Option C still selects `PostgresPrismaJobStore` from the
  built-in fleet — the operator just needs to additionally bind
  `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` (an explicit wire-up step they'd
  do anyway in production). The stock build supports all three ids
  out of the box with config.
- **Future admin endpoint is unblocked.** A separate spec can add
  a `KNOWN_STORE_IDS = ['memory', 'sqlite', 'postgres'] as const`
  constant to `apps/api/src/jobs/store-bootstrap.factory.ts` so
  `GET /api/storage/backends` lists every available id (not just
  the active one).

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option C. Revisit if the
"lazy resolve = registry only sees active" trade-off bites a future
admin / observability feature, at which point an
`AppStoreModule.forActiveWithRegistry(...)` variant could fan out
metadata-only registration without instantiation.

## Q-018 — Aggregator persistence wiring: opt-in vs opt-out, error policy, observation-store coupling, AggregateResult shape (Spec 004 / T11)

**Context:** T11's acceptance is two lines — "Default behaviour
persists; `persist=false` bypasses." The aggregator already runs the
dedup engine and emits `DedupResult.canonical` (the `CanonicalJob[]`
to persist) plus per-input `assignments`. Five latent design choices
weren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Default `persist`?** The acceptance line spells it out — "Default
   behaviour persists" → default `true`. Confirmed; no question.
2. **What happens when no `IJobStore` is bound?** Two reasonable
   shapes: (a) silently treat as `persist=false` (back-compat: every
   existing test runs without a store binding); (b) hard fail at
   request time with `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND`. (a) keeps tests honest
   without forcing every test fixture to wire a store; (b) makes
   misconfigured prod loud. Spec 004 §7.3 reserves the
   `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` code for **bootstrap** (T12), so request-time
   should NOT raise it.
3. **Persistence failures: throw or swallow?** The aggregator is on
   the hot path of `POST /api/jobs/search`. Three options: (a) bubble
   any `IJobStore.upsertMany` rejection to the caller — a transient
   DB blip turns every search into a 500; (b) swallow + `logger.warn`
   + still return the deduped list — the user gets results, the
   operator gets a log line; (c) swallow + structured `persistError`
   field on `AggregateResult` so the controller can surface a
   header / metric without blocking the response. Spec 004 §7.3's
   `ERR_STORE_BACKEND_DOWN` doctrine ("bubble with retry hints") was
   written for explicit store callers (`GET /api/jobs/:id`), not for
   the aggregator's optional persistence side-effect.
4. **Observation-store coupling.** Each `CanonicalJob` carries
   `sources: ReadonlyArray<SourceObservation>`. Two options:
   (a) call `observationStore.putAll(canonicalJobId, sources)` for
   every canonical record so observation history is captured;
   (b) skip observations and let a future T13 add it. Spec 004
   §7 / FR-2 already requires `IJobObservationStore` to be wired by
   the same backend (T04's default `bindObservationStore: true`),
   so capturing observations now is a one-line addition that keeps
   the contract complete.
5. **AggregateResult shape.** Two options: (a) leave `AggregateResult`
   alone — persistence is a side effect — and document the contract
   in JSDoc; (b) extend with optional `persisted?: boolean`,
   `persistCounts?: { inserted: number; updated: number }`, and
   `persistError?: { code: string; message: string }` so the
   controller can echo the outcome in a response header / metric.
   (a) keeps the wire shape stable; (b) gives operators a one-roundtrip
   answer for "did the search persist?".

**Options:**

- **Option A — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip; on
  upsertMany failure log + structured `persistError` (option 3.c);
  capture observations via `IJobObservationStore.putAll`; extend
  `AggregateResult` with `persisted` + `persistCounts` + `persistError`.**
  Lowest blast radius for the hot path: a failing store NEVER turns
  a successful search into a 500. The new fields on
  `AggregateResult` are all optional — every existing controller /
  resolver / test continues to compile unchanged. Persistence is
  best-effort but observable: a future metrics interceptor can read
  `result.persistError?.code` to count `store_persist_failures_total`.
- **Option B — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip;
  bubble upsertMany failures (option 3.a); capture observations;
  extend `AggregateResult` minimally (`persisted` boolean only).**
  Loudest signal but every transient DB blip is a 500 to the user.
  Operationally hostile for the search hot path.
- **Option C — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip;
  swallow upsertMany failures with `logger.warn` (option 3.b); skip
  observations for now; do NOT extend `AggregateResult`.** Smallest
  diff but the controller can't tell whether persistence happened —
  the caller / dashboard has to issue a follow-up `GET /api/jobs`
  to verify, which is racy with concurrent writes.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #25).** Reasons:
- Best-effort persistence keeps the search hot path 100 % available
  during an unrelated DB blip (Spec 004 / NFR-4 budgets cold-start
  at 750 ms but says nothing about graceful degradation; Option A
  fills that gap).
- Capturing observations alongside canonical records keeps the
  store contract (FR-1 + FR-2) complete in the only writer the API
  has, so a future analytics query can rely on
  `IJobObservationStore.listByCanonicalId` without a backfill.
- The `persistError` field on `AggregateResult` is the cheapest way
  to surface partial failure to the caller without breaking the
  response envelope. The controller stays a one-liner; metrics /
  alerting can be added later by a separate spec without re-wiring
  the aggregator.
- Silently skipping when no store is bound matches the dedup-engine
  precedent (Spec 003 / T13: "When no engine is bound the aggregator
  is a pass-through"). Operators who set `EVER_JOBS_STORE` get
  bootstrap-time validation in T12; until then, persistence is a
  no-op rather than a runtime error.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if
operator feedback shows the swallow-and-log pattern is hiding real
production issues, at which point a `STORE_PERSIST_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`
(consecutive failures → bootstrap-style fail-fast) would be a
cleaner escalation than per-request bubbling.

## Q-017 — Admin force-open / force-reset endpoint: route shape, auth strictness, response payload, invalid-site code (Spec 005 / T07)

**Context:** T07's acceptance is exactly two lines —
"Add `POST /api/sources/:site/circuit/{open,reset}` (auth-required)"
and "Force-open succeeds with valid API key; 401 otherwise." Four
latent design choices aren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the route live?** Two reasonable homes:
   - Same `SourcesHealthController` (`@Controller('api/sources')`)
     so the URL surface stays grouped under one controller and one DI
     graph (the breaker is already injected here).
   - A separate `SourcesAdminController` so the read-only `GET health`
     stays logically distinct from mutating writes.
2. **How is "auth-required" enforced when the global `ApiKeyGuard` is
   currently a no-op?** Today the guard returns `true` whenever
   `auth.enabled=false` **or** `apiKeys.length === 0`. That's fine for
   read-mostly routes but an attacker could force-open every source in
   a deploy that hasn't set `ENABLE_API_KEY_AUTH=true`. The route
   contract needs a stricter, per-route override. Three shapes:
   - **Reflector-driven `@AdminAuth()` decorator** + the existing
     `ApiKeyGuard` reads metadata. When the route is marked admin, it
     **always** validates a key (ignoring `auth.enabled`); when no
     keys are configured at all, it returns 503 (admin disabled by
     misconfiguration) rather than silently allowing the request.
   - A second guard (`AdminApiKeyGuard`) wired with `@UseGuards()` on
     the route only. Cleaner separation, but two guards now read the
     same `ConfigService` config-tree.
   - A `requireAuth: true` flag wired into `ApiKeyGuard` via a
     class-level prop. Doesn't compose with multiple admin routes that
     could live in different controllers.
3. **What does the admin endpoint return?** Two natural choices:
   - 200 + `{ ok: true, site, health: SourceHealth }` — operator
     dashboards can re-render the per-site row from the same payload.
   - 204 No Content — smaller wire, but the dashboard then has to
     issue a follow-up `GET /api/sources/health` to confirm the state.
4. **What status code for an unknown `:site`?** Two natural choices:
   - 404 Not Found ("URL identifies no such source").
   - 400 Bad Request ("path param is not a `Site` enum value").

**Options:**

- **Option A — Same controller, `@AdminAuth()` decorator + Reflector
  read in `ApiKeyGuard`, 200 + `{ ok, site, health }`, 404 for unknown
  site.** Adds one new file (`apps/api/src/auth/admin-auth.decorator.ts`)
  and one new branch in `ApiKeyGuard.canActivate`. The existing
  `health.controller.ts` grows two methods. The 401-on-missing /
  401-on-invalid contract is exact (T07 acceptance: "401 otherwise"
  — both branches throw `UnauthorizedException`). Misconfigured
  deploys with `apiKeys=[]` get 503, which is operator-fixable.
- **Option B — Separate `SourcesAdminController` + dedicated
  `AdminApiKeyGuard` via `@UseGuards()`, 204 No Content, 400 for
  unknown site.** Cleanest physical separation; two new files. The
  204 path means the e2e test for "valid key force-opens the breaker"
  has to issue a second request to verify state, which is brittle if
  another test interleaves a `forceReset`. The 503-on-misconfigure
  branch is the same.
- **Option C — Same controller, in-place `requireAuth` flag on
  `ApiKeyGuard`, 200 + bare `SourceHealth`, 400 for unknown site.**
  Lowest-LOC, but the in-place flag doesn't compose if a future
  controller needs admin auth in another module — the flag is a
  global instance property.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #16).** Reasons:
- Reflector-driven decorator composes cleanly with future admin
  routes in any controller (e.g. a future `POST /api/plugins/:id/disable`
  re-uses `@AdminAuth()` with no extra wiring).
- Returning the full `SourceHealth` after the action lets dashboards
  re-render the per-site row from one round-trip — matches operator
  workflow ("force-open → confirm in UI").
- 404 for unknown `:site` matches REST conventions: the URL points
  to a resource (the source) that doesn't exist.
- The same controller keeps the DI graph shallow — both routes need
  the breaker that's already injected.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if a
future feature requires multiple admin tiers (e.g. read-only ops vs
full admin), at which point the Reflector key would graduate from
`AdminAuth` to a roles-based `RequireRole(...)` decorator.

---

## Q-016 — Per-plugin `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()` discovery: where does the bootstrap live, when does it run, what about hot-swap (Spec 005 / T08)

**Context:** T08's acceptance is just "Plugin-defined policy wins over
default at registration." The interface (`ICircuitBreakerPolicyProvider`),
the type guard (`hasCircuitBreakerPolicy`), and the breaker setter
(`CircuitBreakerService.setPolicy(site, policy)`) are all already in
place from T01/T02 — T08 is purely the wiring. Three latent design
choices weren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the bootstrap live?** Spec 005 / `tasks.md` planned the
   work inside `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`
   — but `CircuitBreakerService` doesn't (and shouldn't) know about
   `PluginRegistry`. Teaching the breaker to scan plugins would create
   a back-edge that breaks AGENTS.md §0.2's "every plugin replaceable"
   invariant: a custom breaker plugged in via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN`
   would silently lose policy overrides.
2. **When does the bootstrap run?** `PluginDiscoveryService.onModuleInit`
   populates the registry. Running override-discovery in another
   `OnModuleInit` would be a race; running in
   `OnApplicationBootstrap` (which fires after every module's
   `OnModuleInit`) is race-free but means the override only applies
   to plugins registered *during* discovery — not to community
   plugins registered later via
   `PluginRegistry.registerExternal(...)`.
3. **What about hot-swap?** Should `PluginRegistry.register` itself be
   updated to call `breaker.setPolicy` when the new scraper implements
   `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()`? That couples the registry to the
   breaker (against AGENTS.md §0.2 again).

**Options:**

- **Option A — Separate provider in `JobsModule`,
  `OnApplicationBootstrap`, `applyPluginPolicies()` exposed as a public
  re-trigger.** Mirrors the T06 `MetricsCircuitBreakerBridge` pattern.
  The bootstrapper owns *both* dependencies (`PluginRegistry` is
  global; `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` is bound by `CircuitBreakerModule`
  imported from `JobsModule`) and so violates neither §5 (no peer
  imports) nor §0.2 (every component pluggable). Late-registered
  plugins can re-trigger discovery via the public method without
  writing a new bootstrapper. A throw inside
  `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()` is caught — the affected `Site` keeps
  `DEFAULT_CIRCUIT_POLICY` — so a buggy plugin can't take down the
  pass.
- **Option B — Teach `CircuitBreakerService` about `PluginRegistry` directly.**
  Inject `PluginRegistry` into `CircuitBreakerService` in
  `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/`. Simplest dependency graph
  but breaks AGENTS.md §0.2: any custom breaker plugged in through
  `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` would have to re-implement the override
  scan or silently lose it.
- **Option C — Wrap `PluginRegistry.register` to push policy synchronously.**
  Override-discovery runs at the moment of registration, with no
  bootstrap step. Tightens coupling between the registry and the
  breaker, and means `register` is now async-effectful rather than
  pure. Doesn't help `registerExternal` callers any more than Option A
  + the documented re-trigger does.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #15).**
Option A keeps the breaker pluggable, keeps the registry pure, and
matches the T06 bridge pattern — operators only have to learn one
"per-feature wiring provider in `JobsModule`" idiom. The public
`applyPluginPolicies()` method is the documented hot-swap escape
hatch, exercised by the integration suite. A future task could lift
the bootstrapper into a generic `BootstrapHooks` mechanism if a third
"discovery + token-based wiring" feature appears, but that abstraction
is premature with two cases.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if a
future plugin needs synchronous policy application at registration
(e.g. to override the policy *before* the very first call) — the
current bootstrap order is "first call may briefly use the default
policy if it lands before `OnApplicationBootstrap`," which is
acceptable for steady-state operation but could matter for a startup
self-test.

## Q-015 — Prometheus exposition of `source_circuit_state`: bridge wiring, state encoding, label set (Spec 005 / T06)

**Context:** T06's acceptance is just "`curl /metrics` includes
`source_circuit_state{site=...}`." Three latent design choices weren't
called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the breaker connect to the Gauge?** `MetricsModule` is
   `@Global()`; `CircuitBreakerModule` is **not** — it's imported by
   `JobsModule`. So `MetricsService` cannot inject `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN`
   directly without either (a) making `CircuitBreakerModule` global (wide
   blast radius — every test bootstrap that pulls `MetricsModule` would
   suddenly see a breaker), (b) reaching across modules at runtime
   (forbidden by AGENTS.md §5 plugin rule), or (c) introducing a small
   bridge provider that owns *both* dependencies and writes the breaker
   into the Gauge's `collect()` callback.
2. **State encoding.** Prometheus Gauges are numeric. The natural
   encodings are: `closed=0, half-open=1, open=2` (degradation severity
   ascending), or `closed=0, open=1, half-open=2` (open-vs-rest binary
   first), or three separate Gauges (`source_circuit_state_closed`,
   …_open, …_half_open) each at 0/1. The first matches Spec 005's
   FR-1/FR-2 mental model (graduating severity) and lets a single
   `max_over_time(source_circuit_state[5m]) >= 2` alert trigger on any
   open episode.
3. **Label set.** `{site}` is the only label `tasks.md` mandates. Should
   we also expose `{state}` as a second label so PromQL can sum by
   state without remembering the encoding? That would mean *three* time
   series per site (one per state, value 0 or 1) — for ~190 sites
   that's ~570 series. Acceptable but >2× the cardinality.

**Options:**

- **Option A — Bridge provider, single-Gauge severity encoding, `{site}`-only label.**
  Add `CircuitBreakerMetricsBridge` in `apps/api/src/jobs/`
  (a Nest provider with `OnApplicationBootstrap`) that injects both
  `MetricsService` and `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` and calls
  `metricsService.bindCircuitBreakerSource(() => breaker.list())`.
  The Gauge `ever_jobs_source_circuit_state{site}` reports
  `closed=0, half-open=1, open=2`. `MetricsService` exposes a
  `bindCircuitBreakerSource(fn)` setter that wires the source into the
  Gauge's `collect()` callback — when no source is bound, `collect()`
  is a no-op and the metric is simply absent (back-compat with test
  bootstraps that don't import `JobsModule`). HELP text records the
  encoding.
- **Option B — Make `CircuitBreakerModule` `@Global()` and inject `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` directly into `MetricsService`.**
  Wires straight from breaker to Gauge with no bridge. Simpler dependency
  graph but inverts the Spec 005 / FR-3 plugin model — the breaker is
  meant to be a swappable plugin imported once at the application
  boundary, not an ambient global. Also forces every consumer of
  `MetricsService` (cache, future analytics dashboards) to pull the
  breaker into their bootstrap.
- **Option C — Three Gauges (`…_closed`, `…_open`, `…_half_open`) with `{site}` label.**
  Each Gauge reports 0 or 1. PromQL becomes `source_circuit_state_open == 1`.
  No encoding to remember; double the series count; mismatches the
  spec's "`source_circuit_state{site}`" wording (the spec names a
  *single* metric).

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #14).**
Option A keeps the breaker pluggable (no global), keeps cardinality at
~190 series (one per site), matches the spec's metric naming exactly,
and degrades cleanly when the bridge isn't wired (the Gauge is simply
absent from `/metrics`). The encoding is documented in the Gauge's
HELP text so PromQL authors don't need to read code.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if
operators surface friction with the numeric encoding.

## Q-014 — `/api/sources/health` shape, registry-overlay default, and auth posture (Spec 005 / T05)

**Context:** T05's acceptance is just "Returns array of `SourceHealth`;
cache-control 1 s." Three sub-questions emerged while authoring the
controller:

1. **Response shape.** `{ count, sources }` envelope vs raw array
   `SourceHealth[]`?
2. **Registry overlay.** `breaker.list()` only returns sites the breaker
   has actually observed (lazy init). Should the endpoint also list every
   *registered* source plugin so a fresh process surface a "no data yet,
   closed" row for the ~190 sites?
3. **Auth posture.** FR-7 explicitly says "auth-required" for the
   `POST /circuit/{open|reset}` admin paths. By implication FR-5 (this
   read endpoint) is **not** auth-required. Should T05 still gate it
   behind `ApiKeyGuard`?

**Options:**

- **Option A — Envelope shape, opt-in overlay, no extra auth.**
  Response is `{ count, sources: SourceHealth[] }`. Default returns only
  sites the breaker has observed; `?include=all` overlays the rest.
  Endpoint is subject to the existing global `ApiKeyGuard` (which is
  no-op when `auth.enabled=false`, the deployed default). Memory-safe
  by design — the overlay never calls `breaker.health(site)` for unseen
  sites (which would create real entries and balloon the ~190 × 1 KB
  ceiling per Spec 005 / NFR-3).
- **Option B — Raw array, always overlay, public.**
  Response is `SourceHealth[]`. Always returns every registered plugin.
  Endpoint exempt from `ApiKeyGuard`. Simpler client-side but forces
  every dashboard to render ~190 rows even when only 1 site has been
  called; eager overlay also sacrifices the lazy-init memory property.
- **Option C — Envelope shape, always overlay, no extra auth.**
  Hybrid of A's envelope and B's eagerness. Same memory regression as
  B; less surprising than B for clients (envelope is more idiomatic
  REST).

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #13).**
The envelope is friendlier to monitoring scripts that want
`count`-style alerting; the opt-in overlay keeps the default response
small (only "interesting" sites) while still being reachable for
operators who want a complete picture (`?include=all`); leaving the
endpoint subject to the global guard preserves the deploy-time choice
in `auth.enabled` (operators who want it private just enable the guard).

**Resolution:** Option A (run #13). Documented in
`apps/api/src/jobs/health.controller.ts` and exercised by 5 e2e cases
in `apps/api/__tests__/e2e/sources-health.e2e-spec.ts`. Revisit if a
real client surfaces friction with the envelope shape — the controller
already returns `sources` as a stable array so a future un-wrapping
would be a 1-line change.

## Q-013 — Circuit-breaker wiring point: `JobsAggregator` vs `JobsService` (Spec 005 / T04)

**Context:** Spec 005 plan.md §1 says the breaker is "applied to the
aggregator's per-source dispatch — *not* to the controller, because the
breaker is a per-source concern, not a per-request one." Tasks.md /
T04 names `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.aggregator.ts` as the file to patch
and `Acceptance: 1-of-3 always-fail fake plugins → aggregator returns
2 results.` While inspecting the dispatch path during run #12 we found
that the per-source `scraper.scrape()` fan-out actually lives in
`JobsService.searchJobs` (which `JobsAggregator.aggregate` delegates
to). `JobsAggregator` itself runs **after** fan-out — its job is the
dedup pass; it never sees individual sources.

**Options:**

- **A. Refactor `JobsAggregator` to own the per-source dispatch.**
  Move the `selectedScrapers.map(...)` loop out of `JobsService`, wire
  the breaker there. Pro: matches T04's named file. Con: ~150 LOC of
  refactor cuts across `JobsService` (routing + retries + metrics +
  salary post-processing), needs to keep `JobsAggregator.aggregate`
  vs `aggregateRaw` working without a regression in the existing
  Spec 003 / Phase 5 dedup flow. High blast radius for a Phase 2 wire.
- **B. Wire the breaker into `JobsService` (the actual dispatch
  site).** `@Optional()` inject `CircuitBreakerInterceptor` and wrap
  `scraper.scrape(scraperInput)` with `interceptor.wrap(site, …)`. Pro:
  lands FR-1 ("wraps every `IScraper.scrape()` call") exactly where
  the call happens; back-compat for tests that don't import
  `CircuitBreakerModule` is automatic via `@Optional()`. Tasks.md /
  T04's *acceptance* — "1-of-3 always-fail fake plugins → aggregator
  returns 2 results" — still holds end-to-end through the aggregator
  because the aggregator delegates to the service.
- **C. Wire it in *both* layers.** Belt-and-suspenders. Pro: makes the
  task description literally true. Con: introduces a meaningless
  second wrap (the aggregator's dispatch IS the service's dispatch),
  doubles the `wrap` overhead, fragments where the breaker's
  observability lives.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Wire into `JobsService`** — the
acceptance criterion is the contract; the file name in T04 was a
proxy for "the dispatch site". Wiring at the actual dispatch point
keeps the change minimal (~15 LOC) and honours FR-1 literally.
Tasks.md was annotated with "Files (planned) / Files (actual)" so the
deviation is visible.

**Resolution:** **2026-04-27 (run #12) — Option B.** Implementation
landed in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.service.ts` +
`apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.module.ts`; integration suite at
`apps/api/__tests__/integration/circuit-breaker.spec.ts` (4 cases,
all green) demonstrates the T04 acceptance.

## Q-012 — Circuit-breaker engine: `opossum` vs hand-rolled state machine (Spec 005 Phase 1)

**Context:** Spec 005 plan.md §1 suggested wrapping the
[`opossum`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opossum) Node circuit-breaker
library inside a NestJS service to "avoid hand-rolling state transitions
(would otherwise be a primary risk)". Spec 005 §FR-2 then specifies the
default policy as **"5 consecutive failures → open"** with a 30 s
cooldown. While inspecting `opossum`'s API for T02 we found that the
library models failures as an `errorThresholdPercentage` over a rolling
count window (`rollingCountTimeout` × `rollingCountBuckets`). It does
**not** ship a "N consecutive failures" trigger; emulating consecutive-
failure semantics requires post-event monkey-patching of the breaker's
internals, which would itself be a fragility risk.

**Options:**

- **A. Wrap `opossum`.** Configure `volumeThreshold: 5` +
  `errorThresholdPercentage: 100` so 5 errors in the rolling window
  open the breaker. Approximates the contract but is not strictly
  consecutive — a single mid-window success does not reset the count
  the way Spec 005 / FR-2 expects. Downside: behavioural drift
  surfaces only under load, where it's hardest to debug.
- **B. Wrap `opossum` + custom counter overlay.** Use `opossum` for
  cooldown/half-open mechanics, add a side-channel counter that
  resets on `success` and triggers `breaker.open()` on the threshold.
  Touches `opossum`'s public events but doesn't subclass it.
  ~80 LOC of glue plus the dep.
- **C. Hand-rolled state machine in
  `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`.**
  ~250 LOC including doc comments. Implements the exact FR-2
  contract: counter increments on failure, resets on success, opens
  at threshold, half-open after `cooldownMs`, reopens with a fresh
  cooldown on probe failure. Fully unit-testable via an injectable
  clock seam (`setClock`). No new dependencies.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Hand-rolled state machine** — Spec 005's
contract is firmer than its plan; consecutive-failure semantics is
explicit (`§5 / FR-2`) and matches operator intuition ("the source
broke five times in a row, kill it"). The `opossum` wrap path's
behavioural drift would only show up at production scale. Hand-rolling
also lets us:
  - inject a deterministic clock for unit tests (no `jest.useFakeTimers`
    timing-flake risk),
  - cap memory at `MAX_SAMPLES = 600` per site explicitly, satisfying
    Spec 005 / NFR-3,
  - publish exactly the `ICircuitBreakerService` shape declared in
    `@ever-jobs/models` without leaking `opossum`'s event-emitter API.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. Hand-rolled state machine** in run #10
(2026-04-26). Implementation in
`packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`. 14
unit tests in
`__tests__/circuit-breaker.service.spec.ts` cover the full state-machine
matrix. Will revisit option A only if a future requirement (e.g.
half-open back-pressure, distributed breaker) makes a battle-tested
library a better fit. The `setClock` test seam plus the strict
`ICircuitBreakerService` interface keeps that swap a 1-day commit if
ever needed.

## Q-011 — Doc-lint markdown parser choice (Spec 002 Phase 3, T11)

**Context:** Spec 002 plan.md §4 listed `remark-parse` + `unified` as the
suggested deps for `scripts/docs-lint.ts`. Both are popular and battle-tested,
but they pull a 30+ transitive-dep graph into the build for what is a small
build-time tool. The five lint checks (broken internal links, unindexed docs,
duplicate log entries, newest-at-top ordering, spec-file frontmatter
presence) all operate on a small surface of the markdown grammar — inline
`[text](href)` links plus `## YYYY-MM-DD — Scheduled run #N` headers.

**Options:**

- **A. `remark-parse` + `unified` (the plan's suggestion).** Full markdown AST.
  Future-proof if we later want to lint heading levels, table integrity,
  list nesting, footnotes, etc. ~30 transitive deps; ~2 MB install footprint;
  startup cost ~150 ms.
- **B. `remark-parse` only, no `unified`.** Same AST without the streaming
  pipeline. Saves ~5 deps. Still a heavy install for a build-time tool.
- **C. Zero-dep regex parser in-tree.** ~150 LOC; no install footprint;
  startup cost negligible. Requires us to handle code fences (` ``` ` and
  `~~~`), inline-code spans, link-text escapes, and `:line` / `#frag` /
  `?query` URL suffixes manually. Falls down on reference-style links
  (`[text][ref]` + `[ref]: url`), nested brackets, and HTML inside markdown
  — none of which appear in our docs today.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Zero-dep regex parser** — keeps the doc-lint
job lightweight (CI step <10 s end to end including `npm ci`), avoids the
risk of a future remark major bump breaking the lint, and matches the
shape of the markdown we actually write. If we ever need full-AST checks
(table-divider validation, list-nesting consistency, frontmatter YAML), we
can swap to option A behind the same `lintDocs(repoRoot)` interface
without touching CI wiring.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. Zero-dep regex parser** in run #9 (2026-04-26).
Implementation in `scripts/docs-lint.ts`. Will revisit option A only if a
real lint check requires AST traversal that the regex parser can't
deliver cleanly.

## Q-010 — Should the GraphQL `searchJobs` query also dedup by default?

**Context:** Spec 003 Phase 5 (run #7) wired the dedup engine into the REST
endpoint `/api/jobs/search` and added the opt-out `?dedup=false` query param.
The GraphQL resolver in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.resolver.ts` still calls
`JobsService.searchJobs()` directly and bypasses `JobsAggregator`, so it
returns raw fan-out. Spec 003 didn't itemise GraphQL parity.

**Options:**

- **A. Mirror REST.** Inject `JobsAggregator` into `JobsResolver` and add a
  `dedup: Boolean = true` arg to the `searchJobs` GraphQL input. Maximum
  consistency; one extra optional arg in the schema.
- **B. Leave GraphQL as raw-only.** Document the divergence and add a
  follow-up spec for GraphQL `canonicalJobs` that returns `CanonicalJob[]`
  with full provenance. Keeps the current schema stable; clients with
  bespoke ranking logic don't pay the dedup tax.
- **C. Dedup by default with no opt-out.** Smallest schema change; matches
  the "default true" REST migration. But denies GraphQL clients a way to
  inspect raw fan-out for debugging.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Mirror REST** — keeps the public surface
coherent and avoids a class of "why is REST count != GraphQL count" support
tickets. Ship in a future run as a tiny follow-up (T15 candidate); not a
Spec 003 blocker.

**Resolution:** Adopted **A. Mirror REST** in run #8 (2026-04-26). Implementation
in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.resolver.ts` — `JobsResolver` now injects
`JobsAggregator` and runs the same `cache → fan-out → cache write
(raw) → dedup` pipeline as the REST controller. `SearchJobsInput.dedup`
defaults to `true` (opt-out via `dedup: false`). `SearchJobsResult`
gains additive fields (`deduped`, `rawCount`, `dedupMetrics`) for
parity with the REST envelope. Cache key is bumped to
`endpoint=graphql-search-v2` to invalidate v1 entries cleanly. 14
resolver unit tests cover the parity matrix.

## Q-009 — MinHash library choice for Spec 003 Phase 3 stage 2 (T08)

**Context:** Spec 003 plan.md §4 Dependencies suggests `datasketch-js`. Run #4
verified that crate's npm presence is patchy (only one published version, last
push 2017, no TypeScript types). The next stage of the dedup pipeline needs
MinHash + LSH for near-duplicate detection of long descriptions; we have to
choose between a third-party library and a small in-tree implementation.

**Options:**

- **A. `minhash` npm package** (~12 KB, MIT, ~150 K weekly downloads,
  TypeScript types via `@types/minhash`) — battle-tested, but does not ship
  LSH bucketing; we would still write the LSH banding wrapper in-tree.
- **B. `datasketch-js`** — the spec's original suggestion. Stale and untyped;
  mostly a port of Python's `datasketch`. Risk: pulls in extra deps, no
  recent maintainer.
- **C. In-tree implementation** under `packages/plugins/dedup-hybrid/src/strategies/minhash.ts`
  using `crypto.createHash('sha1')` for permutation hashing plus a small LSH
  banding helper. ~150 LOC; no extra deps; full control over signature
  width, band count, and the hot loop.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. In-tree** — keeps the Phase 3 commit zero-dep,
gives us a deterministic baseline for the perf gate (NFR-1 / NFR-2), and
matches AGENTS.md §6 ("Reuse existing libs **when popular & well-maintained**"
— `minhash` qualifies on popularity but we still need to write the LSH layer
ourselves either way, so the dep buys us very little). If perf or correctness
falls short we'll revisit option A in T08 follow-up.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. In-tree** in run #5 (2026-04-26). Implementation
in `packages/plugins/dedup-hybrid/src/minhash.ts` — 128-permutation MinHash,
LSH banding (B=16, R=8), seeded affine permutations, FNV-1a shingle hashing.
Zero dependencies; deterministic given seed. Will revisit option A only if
the perf benchmark or golden-set precision regresses.

## Q-008 — Scrubbing legacy "ported from <competitor>" comments in source files

**Context:** The scheduled-task brief forbids competitor mentions inside this
repo. Run #3 found ~7 pre-existing files with `Ported from <repo>/...` doc
comments (`packages/common/src/utils/experience-extractor.ts`, several
`packages/plugins/source-ats-*/src/*.types.ts`, README acknowledgements,
plus a "StapplyMap" UA string in
`packages/plugins/source-company-cursor/src/cursor.service.ts`).

The brief also says "do NOT remove anything (move or improve is OK)", so a
silent purge isn't appropriate.

**Options:**

- **A. Spec it.** Open a small "Spec 006 — Scrub external-project mentions"
  with a deterministic find-and-rewrite list. Each comment becomes a neutral
  "Reference implementation in upstream Python project" with no name. README
  acknowledgements move to an external file (`/competitor-watch.md`).
- **B. Drop the comments wholesale.** Safe for code; loses provenance breadcrumb.
- **C. Leave as-is** — accept the brief's rule is about *new* mentions, not
  pre-existing breadcrumbs.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Spec it** — keeps history navigable, satisfies
the rule, and gives the cleanup a reviewable diff. Spec will be authored
next run; this run does not touch the legacy comments to keep the
Spec-003-Phase-1+2 commit focused.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-007 — One spec per new source plugin, or one bulk spec for multiple adoptions?

**Context:** Run #2 identified 6 new platforms to adopt
(`source-ats-avature`, `source-ats-gem`, `source-ats-joincom`, `source-ats-oracle`,
`source-mercor`, `source-company-tesla`). Each is similar in shape (URL-pattern
discovery, list endpoint, detail endpoint), so per-plugin specs would be
repetitive.

**Options:**

- **A. One spec per plugin** — six specs (006–011). Cleaner status tracking; each
  plugin can ship independently.
- **B. One bulk "Source-plugin batch — Apr 2026" spec** — single spec with six
  Phase blocks. Less duplication; cohesive review.
- **C. One per category:** an "ATS batch" spec (Avature, Gem, Join.com, Oracle),
  a "Niche / Marketplace" spec (Mercor), a "Company-direct batch" spec (Tesla).

**Default (proceeding):** **A. One spec per plugin** — gives the scheduling
loop a finer granularity and matches the 1-spec-1-package convention used for
the existing 160 plugins. Future runs can opt into bulk specs if review fatigue
shows up.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-006 — Should we adopt **NestJS BullMQ** or **NestJS Bull** for background jobs?

**Context:** Many planned features (scheduled scrapes, dedup, alerts) need queues.

**Options:**

- **A. BullMQ + `@nestjs/bullmq`** — modern, TypeScript-first, supports flows, latest.
- **B. Bull + `@nestjs/bull`** — older, more legacy examples online.
- **C. PostgreSQL-based pg-boss** — no Redis dep, single store.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. BullMQ + `@nestjs/bullmq`** — newest stable, fits perf goals.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-005 — Default persistence backend for jobs?

**Context:** Spec 004 introduces a pluggable persistence layer.

**Options:**

- **A. PostgreSQL (Prisma)** — relational, mature, ecosystem-friendly.
- **B. MongoDB (Mongoose)** — flexible schema for varying source payloads.
- **C. SQLite (Drizzle)** — zero-ops local dev; not for prod.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. PostgreSQL via Prisma** for prod, plus a SQLite Drizzle
adaptor for dev. Both behind the `IJobStore` plugin contract.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-004 — Dedup hashing strategy?

**Context:** Spec 003 needs to identify "the same job" across sources.

**Options:**

- **A. SHA-256 of `(canonicalCompanyName, canonicalJobTitle, canonicalLocation)`** —
  simple, deterministic, collisions on edge cases.
- **B. MinHash / Locality-Sensitive Hashing on description** — handles minor wording
  changes, more compute.
- **C. Hybrid:** A for fast path, fall back to B when score below threshold.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Hybrid** with B reserved for pairs with same hash prefix.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-003 — How aggressive should the circuit breaker default be?

**Context:** Spec 005.

**Options:**

- **A. Open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open at 30 s.**
- **B. Open after 3 consecutive failures, half-open at 60 s.**
- **C. Failure-rate window (50% over last 30 calls).**

**Default (proceeding):** **A** (matches constitution Article 6 §2).

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-002 — Should specs live under `.specify/specs/` *or* `docs/specs/` *or both*?

**Context:** GitHub Spec Kit canonical location is `.specify/specs/`. The task brief
also asks for everything to be discoverable in `docs/`.

**Options:**

- **A. Canonical `.specify/specs/` + auto-generated `docs/specs/` mirrors.**
- **B. Single location: `.specify/specs/`; `docs/index.md` links to them.**
- **C. Single location: `docs/specs/`; abandon `.specify/`.**

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Canonical `.specify/specs/`**, indexed from `docs/index.md`.
Avoids duplication; preserves Spec-Kit conventions.

**Resolution:** _pending review._
